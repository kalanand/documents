The systematic uncertainties were investigated by comparing
the unfolded $m_{jet}$ distribution for each systematic
variation to the nominal value, which is taken from
\PYTHIA. The effects considered are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Parton showering model, estimated by comparing unfolded \PYTHIA to unfolded \HERWIG and assigning the difference as a systematic uncertainty.
\item Jet energy scale, estimated by raising and lowering the jet energy by the measured uncertainty as a function of jet $\pt$ and $\eta$.
\item Jet energy resolution, estimated by increasing and decreasing the jet energy resolution by 10\%. 
The nominal value chosen is 10\%, so the up and down variations 
correspond to 20\% and 0\% additional smearing with respect to the Monte Carlo, respectively. 
\item Jet angular resolution, estimated by increasing and decreasing the jet $\phi$ and $\eta$ resolution by 10\%. 
The nominal value chosen is 10\%, so the up and down variations 
correspond to 20\% and 0\% additional smearing with respect to the Monte Carlo, respectively. 
\item Pileup, estimated by increasing and decreasing the minimum bias cross section by 8\%. 
\end{itemize}

After these effects are investigated, it is found that the dominant uncertainty is
the difference in the parton showering model. All uncertainties are included in
the measurement.
