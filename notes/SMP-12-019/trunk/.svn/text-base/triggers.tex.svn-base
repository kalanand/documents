A mix of different triggers are used to collect events consistent with
the $V$+jet finsl state signature, in some cases varying
significantly across the 2011 dataset. 

For the $W(\mu\nu)$ and $Z(\mu\mu)$ + jet analyses, we use the logical OR of isolated and non-isolated single muon triggers, with variable thresholds as reported below. For the $W(e\nu)$ + jet analysis, we use the logical OR of single electron triggers, where in addition to a tight isolated electron (with variable momentum threshold), we require a 50 GeV cut on the electron plus PFMET transverse mass.

\begin{itemize}
\item
Muon data:\\
     IsoMu17\_v* OR Mu30\_v* \\
Note: We really needed to OR in the nonisolated muon 
trigger as it recovers about half of the offline-isolated 
muons rejected by IsoMu, increasing the trigger efficiency 
by ~5\%.

Note: This epoch was complicated because Mu30, IsoMu17, 
and IsoMu20 were all prescaled for brief periods, so we 
could either break it down into sub-epochs or lump them 
together. We chose the latter because it is predominantly 
IsoMu17 and the sub-epoch lumi accounting is painful.

\subsection{Double Electron Triggers}

For the $Z(ee)$+ jet analysis, we use a double electron trigger:

Ele17\_CaloIdL\_CaloIsoVL\_Ele8\_CaloIdL\_CaloIsoVL (early 2011)  and

 Ele17\_Ele8\_CaloIdL\_CaloIsoVL\_TrkIdVL\_TrkIsoVL. 

This trigger allows a lower offline threshold of $20\GeV$ for both electrons.


 

% Z$(\Pe\Pe)$                     & {\tt SingleEG12}             & {\tt Ele17\_CaloIdL\_CaloIsoVL\_Ele8\_CaloIdL\_CaloIsoVL}
%           \\

%           \\

rate.  The current triggers support offline thresholds of $20\GeV$ and $30\GeV$ 
for the muon and electron, respectively.


The same set of single muon triggers are used in the 
$Z(\mu\mu)$+jet  channel, which allows for a low $25/25$ threshold
combination on both muons.
