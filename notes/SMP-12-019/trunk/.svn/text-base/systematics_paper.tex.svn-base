The systematic uncertainties are estimated by modifying the unfolding
response matrix according to the variation in question, and the
systematically-shifted unfolded jet mass is compared to the nominal
value with \PYTHIA. The difference is taken as the uncertainty.


The experimental uncertainties that can affect the unfolding procedure
include the jet energy scale (JES),
jet energy resolution (JER), and jet angular resolution (JAR). 
The jet energy scale is estimated by raising and lowering the jet
energy by the measured uncertainty as a function of jet $\pt$ and
$\eta$ from Ref.~\cite{citeJEC}, typically around 1-2\% for the jets
considered in this analysis. An additional $\pt$- and $\eta$-
independent 1\% uncertainty is included as additional 
uncertainty, to account for differences observed between the measured
$\wboson$ mass in boosted jets in a $\ttbar$-enriched sample, as in
Ref.~\cite{EXO-11-006}. 

The jet energy and angular resolution are estimated by increasing and decreasing the jet energy, 
$\eta$ and $\phi$ resolution by 10\%.
The nominal value chosen is 10\%, motivated by the observed difference between data and simulation 
in the jet energy resolution~\cite{citeJEC}, so the up and down variations 
correspond to 20\% and 0\% additional smearing with respect to the Monte Carlo, respectively. 
We also estimate an uncertainty associated with the pile-up simulated
in the MC, estimated by increasing and decreasing the minimum bias
cross section by 8\%. 

As theoretical uncertainty due to the parton showering model, we
conservatively estimate it by comparing unfolded \MADGRAPH to unfolded
\HERWIG and assigning the difference as a systematic uncertainty.

In the dijet analysis, there is some misassignment from other than dijet topologies
into our dijet selection. This causes a bias in the unfolding procedure which
is enhanced at low transverse momentum. This bias is accounted for with MC,
and this correction is also taken as an additional systematic uncertainty.
This misassignment is not present in the V+jets case. 


In the $\pt$ bins $220-300$ \GeV and $300-450$ \GeV, the region below $m_J < 50$
\GeV is dominated by the unfolding bias uncertainty, around
50-100\%. Above $mjet_J > 50$ \GeV, the JES, JER, JAR, and pile-up
uncertainties contribute roughly 10\% each. For the $\pt$ bins between
$450-1000$ \GeV, the uncertainties are dominated by the parton
shower uncertainty, which is around 50-100\% below the peak of the
distribution and around 5-10\% in the bulk of the distribution. Above
1000 \GeV the uncertainty on the entire jet mass range is statistically dominated.
