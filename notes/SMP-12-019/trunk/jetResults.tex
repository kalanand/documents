In this Section, the detector-level distributions of the jet mass
are investigated. Each of the distributions are made for 
the $\pt^{AVG}$ bins described in Section~\ref{sec:ptBinAssignment}. 
Each of the figures shows the raw event counts per $\pt^{AVG}$ bin,
as a function of the average jet mass $m_J^{AVG}$. 


Figure~\ref{figs:histAK7PtAvgVsMjetGroomOverReco_ratioPlots}
shows a comparison of the jet mass from the groomed jets
divided by the jet mass of matched ungroomed jets, for the
three grooming techniques, for both data and the \PYTHIA Monte Carlo. 
The data and the MC both exhibit similar behavior. In general,
the filtering algorithm (black) is the least aggressive grooming technique,
with groomed jet masses close to the ungroomed case.
The trimming algorithm (red) is moderately aggressive, and the
pruning algorithm (blue) is the most aggressive. In the case of
the pruning algorithm, a bimodal distribution begins to manifest,
which is typical of this algorithm since the parameters we have
chosen require two subjets to be created. In the cases where
the pruned jet mass is close to the ungroomed jet mass, 
jets usually have large ``core'' components
and small amounts of radiation, whereas when the pruned jet
mass is closer to 0, the jets are more symmetrically split
due to gluons splitting into two jets that fall within
our $D=0.7$ parameter.

Figures~\ref{figs:histAK7MjetVsPtAvg_rawDataMCComparisons_stacktrigs_pt_2}-
\ref{figs:histAK7MjetVsPtAvg_rawDataMCComparisons_stacktrigs_pt_5}
show the jet mass distribution for AK7 jets, along with
the trigger breakdown for all of the $\pt^{AVG}$ bins. In each case,
only one trigger contributes to any given $\pt^{AVG}$ bin.

show the detector-level distributions for the various jet grooming
algorithms, compared to predictions from \PYTHIA, \PYTHIA8, and
\HERWIG Monte Carlo samples. Each MC sample is normalized
according to the expected luminosity and computed cross sections.

The unfolded distributions of the 
averge jet mass are also investigated.
In Figures~\ref{figs:unfoldedMeasurementDijets_1_allsys}-
\ref{figs:unfoldedMeasurementDijets_9_Pruned_allsys}, 
the differential cross
section from Eq.~\ref{eq:pdf_mjet_simple} is shown for
various $\pt^{AVG}$ bins, as a function of
$m_{J}^{AVG}$, as described in
Section~\ref{sec:dataSampleAndEventSelection}, 
for ungroomed jets and for different grooming algorithms. 
As described in Eq.~\ref{eq:pdf_mjet_simple},
each distribution in each $\pt^{AVG}$ is separately normalized to
unity, and each bin content is divided by the bin width of the
$m_J^{AVG}$ bin,
so these plots show the probability distribution function of $m_J^{AVG}$,
with units of 1/GeV (see Eq.~\ref{eq:pdf_mjet_simple}). 
The shapes for $m_J^{AVG}$ in the MC samples are
taken directly from the MC.


The statistical uncertainty is shown in light yellow, the uncertainties due to the jet-energy resolution, jet-energy scale, and jet-angular resolution are shown in shades of brown, the uncertainty due to pile-up is shown in green, and the uncertainty due to the parton shower differences are shown in dark yellow.
The simulated distribution from \PYTHIA is shown in solid black, 
from \PYTHIAEIGHT in dashed red, and from \HERWIG in dotted blue. 
The bottom frame shows the ratio of the true distribution from
the simulation divided by the unfolded distribution, along with
the uncertainties in the unfolded distribution. 


Figures~\ref{figs:unfoldedMeasurementDijets_1}-
\ref{figs:unfoldedMeasurementDijets_9_Pruned}, 
show the same plots, however in a simplified format with only the
total and statistical uncertainties shown in dark yellow and 
light yellow, respectively.

%The unfolded distributions of the 
%average jet mass are also investigated.
We present in this section the unfolded distributions of the 
average jet mass.
In Figures~\ref{figs:unfoldedMeasurementDijets_all}-
%\ref{figs:unfoldedMeasurementDijets_all_Pruned},
\ref{figs:unfoldedMeasurementDijets_allfrac_Pruned}
%\ref{figs:unfoldedMeasurementDijets_5_Pruned}, 
the differential cross
section from Eq.~\ref{eq:pdf_mjet_simple} is shown for
various $\pt^{AVG}$ bins, as a function of
$m_{J}^{AVG}$, as described in
Section~\ref{sec:dataSampleAndEventSelection}, 
for ungroomed jets and for different grooming algorithms. 
As described in Eq.~\ref{eq:pdf_mjet_simple},

$m_J^{AVG}$ bin,
so these plots show the probability distribution function of $m_J^{AVG}$,
with units of 1/GeV (see Eq.~\ref{eq:pdf_mjet_simple}). 
%The shapes for $m_J^{AVG}$ in the MC samples are
%taken directly from the MC. 
The unfolded data are shown in
black circles, and the 
total and statistical uncertainties shown in dark yellow and 
light yellow, respectively. The \HERWIG truth prediction is shown in
dotted blue. 
%Figures~\ref{figs:unfoldedMeasurementDijets_allfrac}-
%\ref{figs:unfoldedMeasurementDijets_allfrac_Pruned},
Following each differential cross-section distribution, we also show
the ratio of the MC truth to the differential cross
sections above for \PYTHIA in solid black, 
for \PYTHIAEIGHT in dashed red, and for \HERWIG in dotted blue.

In all case, the distributions are truncated in the tails for
visibility purposes. Jet-mass bins with a relative uncertainty larger
than 100\% are not displayed to avoid overlapping with other
$\pt^{AVG}$ bins with a more precise measurement in that bin. 

The agreement with the \HERWIG parton-shower model seems to be the
best for $\pt^{AVG} > 300$ \GeV and $m_{J}^{AVG} > 20$ \GeV.
% Above $\pt^{AVG} > 300$ \GeV, the 
%\HERWIG model seems to describe the jet mass very well above
%$m_{J}^{AVG} > 50$ \GeV. 
%After applying the various grooming techniques,
%the agreement is even improved, and the agreement begins
%at around $m_{J}^{AVG} > 20$ \GeV. 
However, the filtering algorithm seems to have slightly worse agreement again 
for $20 < m_{J}^{AVG} < 50$ \GeV when $\pt^{AVG} > 450$ \GeV.

For all of the generators and all of the $\pt^{AVG}$ bins, 
the agreement gets better for
larger jet masses. At the very lowest jet masses, the disagreement
is the largest: this is the most sensitive region to UE/PU and the amount of showering in the simulation seems underestimated. 

The largest systematic effect is the difference in the
unfolding using different parton shower models, with
subleading, but still significant, uncertainties due to
jet energy scale and resolution, and
small contributions from jet angular resolution and pileup. 
For the first two $\pt^{AVG}$ bins, there is also
some contribution from unfolding bias in the lower
jet mass regions, but this is negligible for
$\pt^{AVG} > 450$ \GeV.
