\abstract{
In the last few years, many studies have highlighted the potential of using jet substructure techniques
to improve the sensitivity in the identification of hadronic decays of boosted heavy particles. These studies rely upon
the assumption that the internal structure of jets, including the mass, generated by QCD radiation is well
understood. We investigate the effect of several different jet
substructure algorithms on the jet mass in samples comprising dijet and vector-boson-plus-jet events. 
Based on a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of
\intlumi, recorded by the CMS detector in proton-proton collisions at
the LHC with a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV during 2011, jet
invariant mass spectra for anti-$k_\mathrm{T}$ jets with $R= 0.7$ with
different substructure algorithms as well as Cambridge-Aachen $R$=0.8
and $R$=1.2 are presented. Leading-order parton-shower Monte Carlo
predictions for these variables are found to be in good agreement with
the data, and the agreement is observed to improve with the appliation
of jet-grooming techniques.

% Do not comment out the following hypersetup lines (metadata). They will disappear in NODRAFT mode and are needed by CDS.
% Also: make sure that the values of the metadata items are sensible and are in plain text (no TeX! -- for \sqrt{s} use sqrt(s) -- this will show with extra quote marks in the draft version but is okay).
