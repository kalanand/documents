We present a search for the Standard Model Higgs boson decaying to two W bosons with the subsequent

\section{Introduction}
A primary goal of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)~\cite{lhc-paper} experiments is to study the
mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking where the W and Z bosons acquire mass while the
photon, $\gamma$, remains massless. The Standard Model (SM) postulates the
mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking with the Higgs field as a possible
explanation~\cite{Englert:1964et, Higgs:1964pj, Guralnik:1964eu}. A consequence of the Higgs field
would be existence of the spin-zero Higgs boson (H) with quantum numbers of the vacuum,
$J^{PC}=0^{++}$. Indirect measurements~\cite{LEP:2010zz} and direct searches~\cite{TevHiggsLimit}
suggest that the mass of the SM Higgs boson would most likely fall below 200\GeVnn,
with part of this range already excluded by direct limits from
LHC~\cite{HIG-11-032,ATLAS-CONF-2011-112}. 
However, these constraints are either of limited scope or
rely on various theoretical assumptions, and therefore the aim of the LHC experiments is to explore
all accessible masses including those above 200\GeVnn.

The primary production mechanism of the Higgs boson at the LHC is gluon fusion
(gg)~\cite{Dawson:1990zj,Spira:1995rr,Harlander:2002wh,Anastasiou:2002yz,Ravindran:2003um,
Catani:2003zt,Aglietti:2004nj,Actis:2008ug,Anastasiou:2008tj,deFlorian:2009hc} with a small but
measurable contribution from weak boson fusion (VBF)~\cite{Ciccolini:2007jr,Ciccolini:2007ec,
Figy:2003nv, Arnold:2008rz, Bolzoni:2010xr, Figy:2010ct} and more rare contributions from other
processes. The decay of the Higgs boson to two 
%%light fermions is highly 
%%suppressed~\cite{Djouadi:1997yw,hdecay2,Bredenstein:2006rh,Bredenstein:2006ha}.
%%Decay channels of the Higgs boson with two 
gauge bosons provides the greatest discovery potential at the LHC. For Higgs boson masses
$\mH < 2\mW$ the final states contain two photons or two weak bosons, ZZ or WW, one of which is a
virtual particle. For $\mH \ge 2\mW$, the main final states are those with two on-shell bosons:
$\Wp\Wm$ for $2 \mW \le \mH < 2 \mZ$, and additionally $\Zo\Zo$ for $\mH \ge 2\mZ$. The WW channel, 
where one W decays leptonically and provides the main trigger elements while the other decays
hadronically, has the largest branching fraction and has a reconstructable Higgs mass
peak~\cite{intro2}. The main experimental challenge is to control the large W+jets background.


In this article we present an optimized search for the SM Higgs boson decaying to two W bosons, one
of which decays leptonically while the other decays hadronically. Previous searches in this channel
include the recent ATLAS search \cite{ATLAS:2011ae}. Our data correspond to an integrated luminosity
of $5.02 \pm 0.11\fbinv$ collected with the CMS detector in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 7\TeV$ at
the CERN LHC in 2010 and 2011.
%%The analysis is performed with a sample of proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass
%%energy $\sqrt{s}$ = 7\TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of
%%$(4.7\pm0.2)$ \fbinv recorded by the CMS experiment~\cite{CMS:2010} at the LHC during 2011.
%%We perform a statistical analysis of the selected H candidate events, including
%%all systematic uncertainties.
No evidence for a Higgs boson is found and limits on the corresponding production cross section
are presented for a wide range of masses. 
%%Combined with other Higgs decay channels, these results
%%lead to stringent constraints on the Higgs boson mass.
%%phenomena consistent with the 
%%Higgs mechanism.

\section{The CMS detector}
\label{sec:detector}
CMS~\cite{CMS:2010} uses a right-handed coordinate system, with the origin at the nominal
interaction point, the x-axis pointing to the center of the LHC, the y-axis pointing up
perpendicular to the LHC plane, and the z-axis along the counterclockwise-beam direction. The polar
angle $\theta$ is measured from the positive z-axis and the azimuthal angle $\phi$ is measured in
the x-y plane. The pseudorapidity is defined as $\eta = â\ln(\tan\frac{\theta}{2})$.
%%A detailed description of the CMS detector can be found in ref.~\cite{CMS:2010}.  
%%The central feature of the CMS detector is a 3.8~T superconducting solenoid of 6~m internal diameter. 
%%Within the field volume are the silicon tracker, 
%%the crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and the brass-scintillator hadron calorimeter (HCAL). 
%%The muon system is installed outside the solenoid and embedded in the steel return yoke.
%%The CMS tracker~\cite{trackertdr} consists of 1440 silicon pixel and 15\,148 silicon strip detector modules.
%%The ECAL consists of nearly 76\,000 lead tungstate crystals, which provide coverage 
%%in pseudorapidity $\vert \eta \vert< 1.479$ in the central barrel region and $1.479 <\vert \eta \vert < 3.0$ 
%%in the two forward endcap regions. The ECAL has an energy resolution of better than 0.5\,\% for unconverted photons 
%%with transverse energies above 100~\GeVcnn{}. The HCAL~\cite{Chatrchyan:2009hw} consists of a set of sampling 
%%calorimeters which utilize alternating layers of brass as absorber and plastic scintillator as active material.
%%The muon system includes barrel drift tubes covering the pseudorapidity range $|\eta|< 1.2$, endcap 
%%cathode strip chambers ($0.9< |\eta|< 2.5$), and resistive plate chambers ($|\eta|< 1.6$)~\cite{CMSMUONS:1997}.
%%The pseudorapidity $\eta$ is defined as $\ln\tan(\theta/2)$ with the polar angle $\theta$ measured in the 
%%laboratory frame.
The CMS detector~\cite{CMS:2010} consists of pixel and silicon-strip trackers up to $|\eta| < 2.4$
which, together with a 3.8 Tesla solenoid, provide
%track reconstruction down to about 100 MeV in 
%transverse momentum ($p_T$) and 
a track momentum resolution of 1\% at 100\GeVnn; a granular electromagnetic crystal-calorimeter  
%of $\Delta\eta \times \Delta\phi \approx 0.0174 \times 0.0174$ 
extending up to $|\eta| < 3$ with an energy resolution of about $3\%/\sqrt{E}$; a hadronic
calorimeter extending up to $|\eta| < 5$ with
%a tower granularity of 	
%$\Delta\eta \times \Delta\phi \approx 0.087 \times 0.087$ and 
an energy resolution of $100\%/\sqrt{E}$; and an efficient muon system capable of reconstructing and
identifying muons up to $|\eta| < 2.4$. The detector is nearly hermetic, allowing for measurements
of the missing transverse energy ($\MET$) in the event using a full particle-flow~\cite{PFT-09-001}
reconstruction. A two-tier trigger system selects the events for use in
physics analysis.

\section{Data and Simulation samples}
\label{sec:datamc}
We use data collected with a suite of single lepton triggers mostly using transverse momentum (\PT) 
thresholds of 24\GeVnn for muons and $25-32$\GeVnn for electrons. To preferentially keep only real W
events, the single electron triggers typically also require minimum thresholds on $\MET$ and the
transverse mass \mt of the electron plus $\MET$ system. Simulated Monte Carlo (MC) samples are
corrected for the trigger efficiency.
%%The online event selection is based on the presence of a single muon in the event,
%%or a single electron plus 
%%a minimum \mt calculated with the electron and the MET.

Although the main sources of background are estimated from data, Monte Carlo simulations are used to
develop and validate the methods used in the analysis. We use the \MADGRAPH~\cite{MADGRAPH} event
generator and CTEQ6L1 parton distribution functions to simulate the W boson and Drell-Yan production
in association with up to four jets at the level of matrix element (ME) calculation and matched to
parton showers (PS) from \PYTHIA 6.422~\cite{PYTHIA} tune Z2~\cite{CMSVjets} with a matching
threshold of 20\GeVnn and a dynamic factorization/renormalization scale given by
{\small $\sqrt{m^{2}_{\textnormal{W/Z}} + p^{2}_{\textnormal{T, W/Z}}}$}.
%following the MLM prescription~\cite{MLM}
%with a matching threshold of 10 GeV. 
Top-quark pair events are also simulated using \MADGRAPH. Single top production is modeled using
\POWHEG~\cite{Frixione:2007vw}. Multi-jet and electroweak diboson (WW and WZ semi-leptonic decay)
processes are simulated using \PYTHIA. The \POWHEG generator \cite{Nason:2004rx,Frixione:2007vw,
Alioli:2010xd,Nason:2009ai} has been used to produce Higgs signal events, and the showering has been
performed with \PYTHIA~\cite{PYTHIA}. For this analysis, samples with Higgs mass hypotheses ranging
from 170 to 600\GeVnn have been used. All MC events are fully reconstructed using the standard CMS
software.

%%Background samples are generated using 
%%either {\sc madgraph} 4.4.12~\cite{MADGRAPH}, {\sc alpgen} 2.13~\cite{ALPGEN},
%%or {\sc pythia} 6.4.22~\cite{PYTHIA}. Signal events are generated using
%%{\sc powheg}~\cite{Nason:2004,Frixione:2007,Alioli:2008}.
%%Parton distribution functions (PDF) are modeled using the
%%paramaterizations \textsc{ct10} at NLO~\cite{Lai:2010vv} and \textsc{cteq6}~\cite{CTEQ6:2004} at LO.
%%For both signal and background MC, events are simulated using
%%a {\sc geant4}-based model~\cite{GEANT4} of the CMS detector and processed using the 
%%same reconstruction algorithms as for data.

\section{Event Reconstruction}
\label{sec:reco}
% We reconstruct the full decay chain expected for the SM Higgs boson 
% with semi-leptonic final state.
% %$\HWWlvqq$, where 
% The charged leptons are either muons or electrons, quarks are identified 
% as two or three jets in the CMS detector, where the third jet can originate from 
% an initial or final state gluon radiation from the quarks, 
% and neutrinos originate missing energy. 

% ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ----

\subsection{Leptons}
\label{sec:recolepton}
% To reconstruct the lepton from W decays we follow closely the criteria 
% used in the $W \rightarrow\ell\nu$ analysis~\cite{VBTF}, where 
% $\ell$ denotes an electron or a muon. 
Muons are measured with the all-silicon tracker and the muon system, within $|\eta|<2.4$. Electrons
are detected as tracks in the tracker pointing to energy clusters in the ECAL, within $|\eta|<2.5$, 
excluding the transition region between the barrel and endcap, $1.44<|\eta|<1.57$. Muons (electrons)
are required to have a momentum transverse to the beam direction, \PT, greater than 25\GeVnn
(35\GeVnn).
% Leptons are measured in the pseudorapidity range $|\eta|<2.4$ for muons, 
% and $|\eta|<2.5$ for electrons, though for electrons
% the transition region between the barrel and endcap, $1.44<|\eta|<1.57$, is excluded.
To reduce the background from processes that do not contain $\textnormal{W}\to\ell\nu$ decays, we
require that the transverse mass~\cite{VBTF} of the W candidate be larger than 50\GeVnn.
%%The details of electron and muon identification criteria are described
%%elsewhere~\cite{VBTF}.
%%Both the $\PT$ and $\eta$ requirements are consistent with those in the online 
%%trigger selections.
The lepton candidates are required to be compatible with the primary vertex of the event, which is
chosen as the vertex with highest $\sum \PT^2$ of its associated tracks. According to the simulation,
this requirement provides the correct assignment for the primary vertex in more than 99\% of cases
in both signal and background simulated events. Charged leptons from W boson decays are expected to
be isolated from other activity in the event.
Leptons are therefore required to be isolated from hadronic activity in the detector by restricting
the sum of transverse momentum or energy in the tracker, ECAL, and HCAL, within a surrounding cone
of $\Delta R \equiv \sqrt{(\Delta\eta)^2+(\Delta\phi)^2} <0.3$, to be less than 10\% of the measured
$\PT$ of the muon, or less than 5\% of the measured $\PT$ of the electron, where $\Delta\eta$ and
$\Delta\phi$ are the differences in pseudorapidity and in azimuthal angle in radians.
To reduce the backgrounds from the Drell-Yan and electroweak diboson purely-leptonic decay processes, 
we veto the presence of any other loosely identified lepton (of $\PT > 20\GeVnn$ for electron,
10\GeVnn for muon) in the event.
%%Only one lepton is required to be present in the event,
%%by vetoing the presence of other loosely identified leptons.
The overall efficiency for the lepton selection is about 95\% (64\%) while the trigger efficiency for the
selected leptons is about 94\% (90\%) for muon (electron) events, with a small dependence on \PT and
$\eta$. 

% ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ----

\subsection{Jets}
\label{sec:recojets}
Jets are reconstructed from calorimeter and tracker information using a particle flow
algorithm~\cite{jetpas}, combining the information from all CMS sub-detectors to reconstruct each
particle. The anti-\kt clustering algorithm~\cite{antikt} with distance parameter
${\rm R=0.5}$ is used. The obtained resolution is
$\Delta \PT/\PT \approx 4 / \PT \oplus 0.2 / \sqrt{\PT}$, with $\PT$ in $\GeVnn$. Jets that overlap
with isolated leptons within $\Delta R=0.3$ are not considered.
Jet-energy corrections are applied to account for the non-linear response of the calorimeters to the
particle energies and other instrumental effects. These corrections are based on in-situ
measurements using di-jet, $\gamma+{\rm jet}$, and Z+jet data samples~\cite{Chatrchyan:2011ds}.
Overlapping minimum-bias events coming from different proton-proton collisions (pile-up) and the
underlying event have an effect on jet reconstruction by contributing additional energy to the
reconstructed jets. The median energy density due to pile-up is evaluated in each event and the
corresponding energy is subtracted from each jet~\cite{Cacciari:2008gn}.
A jet quality requirement, primarily based on the energy balance between charged and neutral hadrons
in a jet, is applied to remove misidentified jets. A selection requirement $\PT>30\GeVnn$ is applied
to all jets. Only events with two or three jets above this threshold within the tracker acceptance
($|\eta|<2.4$) are selected for the analysis.
The combination of the two highest $\PT$ jets is chosen as the hadronic W candidate, while the lepton
plus $\MET$ system is considered as the leptonic W candidate.

\subsection{Missing transverse energy}
\label{sec:recoMET}
An accurate $\MET$  measurement is essential for distinguishing the W signal from QCD backgrounds
and to reconstruct the full event kinematics of the WW system. We use $\MET$ measured in the event
using the full particle-flow~\cite{PFT-09-001} reconstruction. The $\MET$ resolution, measured as a
function of the sum $\ET$ ($\Sigma\ET$) of the particle-flow~\cite{PFT-09-001} objects in the
event, varies from 4\% at $\Sigma\ET=60\GeVnn$ to 10\% at $\Sigma\ET=350\GeVnn$~\cite{Chatrchyan:2011tn}.
We require $\MET>25$ (30)\GeVnn in the event in case of muon (electron) data.
In addition, the longitudinal component of the neutrino momentum is reconstructed by imposing the
lepton-neutrino pair to have the invariant mass of a W boson.

% ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ----

\subsection{Kinematic distributions after physics object selection}
\label{sec:controlplots}
Figure~\ref{fig:massesPlots} shows the invariant mass of the di-jet system ($m_{jj}$) and of the
four-body system ($m_{\ell{}\nu{}jj}$) for the muon dataset.
As it can be seen, the main background for this analysis is due to the production of W bosons in
association with jets (W+jets). The requirement $65\GeVnn < m_{jj} < 95\GeVnn$ is then applied in
order to reduce this background.

\section{Fit-based limit extraction}
\label{sec:fit}
A first limit extraction is performed after applying a simple set of selections: lepton $|\eta|<1.5$,
$\Delta\eta_{jj} < 1.5$,  $|\eta_{jj}| < 3$, $65\GeVnn < m_{jj} < 95\GeVnn$. In addition, the 
leptonic W transverse mass is required to be greater than $50$\GeVnn in case of electron data at 
trigger level. An event is discarded if one or more jets with $\PT>30\GeVnn$,
$|\eta|<2.4$, is identified to be generated from a b quark.

The limit extraction is based on the simultaneous fit of signal and background on the
$m_{\ell{}\nu{}jj}$ mass spectrum.
The signal model is derived from simulation, where the scale factors accounting for residual
differences between data and simulation in lepton reconstruction, identification, and triggering
are accounted for. The background model is assumed to be parametric, according to a power law
modulated by a Fermi turn-on function. The systematics due to the statistical fluctuations of the
data are therefore derived from the uncertainty on the fit parameters during the limit extraction
procedure. The choice of this model allows the limit extraction only where the background shows a
monotonic decrease, thus for Higgs mass hypotheses above 250\GeVnn.
The choice of the background model can also introduce a bias affecting the limit determination.
Therefore, a set of alternative background models are considered for each Higgs mass point, and the
average bias in the background determination with respect to the default parametrization is taken as
a systematic uncertainty. 
The alternative background models considered are a simple exponential, a double exponential, 
and the exponentials of a second or third order polynomial, each modulated by the same 
Fermi turn-on function.
Figure~\ref{fig:backgroundShape} shows the four-body mass distribution of the observed events in the
signal region, after the selections applied for the first limit evaluation, fitted for illustrative
purposes with the chosen background-only shape.

\section{Selection optimization}
\label{sec:mva}
To exploit the differences in kinematics between signal and background, a likelihood
discriminant is constructed, that incorporates a minimal full set of variables describing the
Higgs decay, with respect to the W+jets background. Beside improving the expected limit, this
approach allows to extract a limit below the Higgs mass hypothesis of 250\GeVnn. These variables
comprise five angles between the Higgs decay products that fully describe the Higgs production
kinematics~\cite{Gao:2010qx}, the $\PT$ and longitudinal boost (rapidity) of the WW system, and the
lepton charge.

The likelihood variable definition is optimized with dedicated trainings on simulation for 12 Higgs
mass hypotheses (170, 180, 190, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 600\GeVnn), for each
lepton flavor ($e$, $\mu$) and for each jet multiplicity (2 jets, 3 jets) independently. In this
way, 48 different configurations are obtained. For each of them, events are retained if they survive
a simple selection on the likelihood discriminant, chosen on the basis of the expected limit for the
Higgs extraction as the figure of merit. Since the Higgs signal consists of quark jets while the
background is an admixture of both quark and gluon jets, we apply an additional selection on the
sub-leading jet variable that discriminates quark-initiated
jets from gluon-initiated ones~\cite{HIG-11-027}, for Higgs mass values above 500\GeVnn. 
Figure~\ref{fig:mvaPlots} shows the
distribution of the discriminating variables for the muons case at preselection level.

\section{Background yields for the likelihood analysis}
\label{sec:mjjfit}
The background normalization in the signal region is extracted, for each working point independently, 
with an unbinned maximum likelihood fit to the di-jet invariant mass distribution $m_{jj}$ of the
two leading jets. The region corresponding to the W mass window, $65\GeVnn < m_{jj} < 95\GeVnn$, is
excluded from the fit. All the expected backgrounds are considered. The W+jets contribution is
described analytically for high Higgs mass hypotheses, by means of the simulation at low masses
below 180\GeVnn. The electroweak diboson, \ttbar, single top, and Drell-Yan+jets shapes are based
on simulation and their normalization constrained to the theoretical predictions, within the
corresponding uncertainties. The multi-jet background shape is derived from data relaxing isolation
and identification of leptons. Its contribution to the total number of events is evaluated from a
separate two-component likelihood fit to the $\MET$ distribution, as described in Ref.~\cite{VBTF}, 
and constrained in the $m_{jj}$ fit according to this fraction within uncertainties.
Table~\ref{tab:mjjfit} summarizes the determination of the shape and normalization for each
contributing process in the fit. Examples of the $m_{jj}$ fit are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:mjj_mH350}
for muon plus 2 jet channel with selections optimized for Higgs mass hypotheses 190\GeVnn, 350\GeVnn,
and 500\GeVnn. The uncertainties in the normalization obtained from the fit are propagated to the
limit calculation as systematics.

\section{The four-body mass shapes for the likelihood analysis}
\label{sec:4bodymass}
For the limit extraction, the contribution of each background in the signal region
($65\GeVnn < m_{jj} < 95\GeVnn$) is described by the expected shape and normalization.

The four-body mass shape of the W+jets contribution is extracted from data, as a mixture of the
shape measured in two signal-free regions, namely an upper sideband (SBH,
$95\GeVnn <m_{jj} < 115\GeVnn$ ) and a lower sideband (SBL, $55\GeVnn <m_{jj} < 65\GeVnn$):

\begin{equation}
m_{WW_i}^{j} = (1-\alpha^j) \cdot m_{SBH_i}^j + \alpha^j \cdot  m_{SBL_i}^j~,
\label{EqnAlpha}
\end{equation}

where the index $j$ refers to each of the 48 mass spectra and $i$ to the bins in the di-jet mass. The
$\alpha$ factor is chosen for each working point on the simulation by minimizing the $\chi^2$
between the extrapolated shape in the signal region and the expected one. The distributions of the
extrapolated W+jets background in the signal region are shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:Wjets_dd_example} muon 2-jet category with selections  
optimized for Higgs mass hypotheses 190\GeVnn, 350\GeVnn, and 500\GeVnn. 
Because of the low statistics, the shapes are regularized by
means of an exponential fit (red line). The uncertainty in the decay constant for the exponential
shape is utilized to derive the systematic band.

  for muon 2-jets category. The black markers represent the extrapolated points, while the red curve
  is the smooth parametrization using an exponential function. The shaded band shows the envelope of
  the systematic uncertainty in the shape extrapolation.} 
\end{figure}

The four-body mass QCD shape is obtained in a data-driven way as well, by inverting the lepton
isolation requirement to be larger than 0.1 and relaxing the $\MET$ cut to be larger than 20\GeVnn.
All other background categories use the $m_{\ell\nu{}jj}$ shape predicted by their respective Monte
Carlo samples. The $m_{\ell\nu{}jj}$ invariant mass distribution in the signal region is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:mlvjj_mH350} for muon plus 2 jet channel with selections  
optimized for Higgs mass hypotheses 190\GeVnn, 350\GeVnn, and 500\GeVnn.

\section{Systematic uncertainties}
\label{sec:systematics}
% SIGNAL SYSTEMATICS
After rescaling the transverse momentum distribution of the Higgs boson to the HQT
prediction~\cite{Bozzi:2005wk}, we follow the PDF4LHC~\cite{Botje:2011sn,Alekhin:2011sk,Lai:2010vv,
Martin:2009iq,Ball:2011mu} recommendations for the uncertainties on the production cross-section of
the Higgs boson, and for the one due to pdf knowledge effect on the signal acceptance within our
selections. An additional uncertainty is added, to account for the limitation of the narrow Higgs
width approximation in the Higgs simulation, and for the effect of interference with the SM backgrounds.
The uncertainty due to luminosity is considered~\cite{CMSLumi2011}, as well as the one due to the
measurement of the number of pile-up events in data. The uncertainty on the
reconstruction, identification and trigger efficiencies are extracted from the corresponding
measurements, performed with a tag-and-probe approach.
The uncertainty on the jet energy measurements are accounted for considering the uncertainty in the
measurement of the jet energy scale for the fit-based limit extraction, and using the hadronically
decaying W boson in highly pure \ttbar semi-leptonic events for the likelihood-based limit
extraction. In the latter case, the uncertainty is calculated by comparing the reconstructed
hadronic W mass in a \ttbar enriched sample between data and Monte Carlo, and is listed in Table~\ref{tab:signalSyst}.
For the fit-based analysis, the uncertainties due to the difference between data and simulation in
the b-tagging efficiency and mis-tag rate are considered.
For the likelihood-based analysis, the relative difference in efficiency after all the selections
between the \ttbar and Higgs samples in the simulation is considered as an additional systematics to
the Higgs signal efficiency. This accounts for 7\% for $\mH < 500\GeVnn$, for 13\% for
$\mH \ge 500\GeVnn$. The systematic uncertainties on signal are summarized in
Table~\ref{tab:signalSyst}.

 \end{table}

% BACKGROUND SYSTEMATICS
For the fit-based analysis, the uncertainty related to the background fit is directly handled during
the limit extraction. Possible biases due to the choice of the model have been accounted for in the
limit procedure as additional systematics on the signal, as the evaluated average background bias
relative to the expected number of signal events. Both the systematics account for 0.5\% to 3\% of
the number of the background, depending on the Higgs mass hypothesis.\\
For the likelihood based analysis, the largest source of systematic uncertainty is the shape
uncertainty of the W+jets $m_{\ell\nu jj}$ distribution and its normalization, which derives from
the fit of the extrapolated background in the signal region. The uncertainty on the sub-dominant
backgrounds is extracted from the result of the two-body mass fit.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}
Exclusion limits on the SM Higgs boson existence have been calculated with the fit-based
technique and after the likelihood optimization. We use the modified frequentist construction
CL${}_{\textrm{S}}$~\cite{CLS} with profile likelihood as the test statistic. Based on the expected
normalization and shape of the $m_{\ell\nu{}jj}$ distribution, for signal and background, and the
corresponding systematic uncertainties, we generate a large number of random pseudo-experiments. For
each of them, the expected background distribution is generated and a likelihood ratio for signal
plus background, when the signal strength is free to float or is fixed at a given value, is
calculated. We present 95\% exclusion limits on the ratio of the production cross section for the
Higgs boson compared to the SM expectation in Figure~\ref{fig:exclusion}. On the left, the fit-based
limit is shown, on the right the likelihood-based one.

With the fit-based study we exclude the SM Higgs boson in the mass range $325-400\GeVnn$, while with
the likelihood-based study we exclude the SM Higgs boson in the mass range $320-420\GeVnn$.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:summary}
We have presented a search for the SM Higgs boson decaying into two W bosons with semi-leptonic
final state using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 5.0\fbinv at $\sqrt{s}=7\TeV$.
No evidence for the SM-like Higgs boson has been found. We exclude the SM Higgs boson in the mass
range $320-420\GeVnn$ at 95\% confidence level. In combination with analyses of other Higgs decay
channels by the CMS Collaboration, these results allow the exclusion of a wide range of masses for
the Higgs boson.
