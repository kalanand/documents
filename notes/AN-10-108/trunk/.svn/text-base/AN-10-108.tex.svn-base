% 2. **DO NOT use %** to comment out sections of the abstract: the extractor will still grab those lines (and they won't be comments any longer!).

\abstract{
We present a search for new particles decaying to dijets in the dijet mass
spectrum at CMS in pp collisions
at $\sqrt{s}=7$~TeV using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 358 pb$^{-1}$. 
The dijet mass distribution of the two leading jets is measured and compared to QCD predictions 
from PYTHIA propagated through the CMS detector simulation. 
We require the pseudorapidity separation of the two jets 
to satisfy $\mid \Delta\eta \mid < 1.3$ with each jet inside the region 
$\mid \eta \mid < 2.5$. 
We fit the observed dijet mass spectrum with
a parameterization, search for dijet resonances, and set upper limits
at 95\% Confidence Level (C.L.) on the resonance cross section.
These generic cross section limits are compared with theoretical predictions for the cross 
section for several models of new particles: string resonances, axigluons, colorons,  
excited quarks, $E_{6}$ diquarks, Randall-Sundrum gravitons, W' and Z'.
Including statistical uncertainties only we exclude at 95\% C.L. string resonances in the mass
range $0.9 < M(S) < 3.8$ TeV, excited quarks in the mass range $0.9<M(q*)<2.3$ TeV,
axigluons and colorons in the mass range 
$0.9<M(A)<2.3$ TeV, and $E_6$ diquarks in the mass range
$0.9<M(D)<2.7$ TeV.}
