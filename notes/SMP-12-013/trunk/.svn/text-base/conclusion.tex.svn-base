This paper reports a measurement of the $\WW$ cross section in pp collisions at
$\sqrt{s} = 8~\TeV$. The measurement is performed in the $\WW\to\ell\nu\ell\nu$
decay channel, based on a total integrated luminosity of $\usedLumi$. The
measured cross section is \measuredCrossSection, to be compared with
the Standard Model NLO prediction of \nloCrossSection~\cite{MCFM}.
