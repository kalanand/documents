% >> Abstract
% Abstract processing:
% 1. **DO NOT use \include or \input** to include the abstract: our abstract extractor will not search through other files than this one.
% 2. **DO NOT use %**                  to comment out sections of the abstract: the extractor will still grab those lines (and they won't be comments any longer!).
% 3. **DO NOT use tex macros**         in the abstract: External TeX parsers used on the abstract don't understand them.
\abstract{
This document reports on a measurement of the W$^+$W$^-$ production
cross section in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = $ 8~TeV. The data were
collected at the LHC with the CMS detector, and correspond to an
integrated luminosity of 3.54~fb$^{-1}$. The W$^+$W$^-$ candidates are
selected in events with two charged leptons (electrons or muons) and
large missing transverse energy. The W$^+$W$^-$ cross section is
measured to be $69.9 \pm 2.8$~(stat.)~$\pm5.6$~(syst.)~$\pm 3.1$~(lumi.)~pb.

% >> PDF Metadata
% Do not comment out the following hypersetup lines (metadata). They will disappear in NODRAFT mode and are needed by CDS.
% Also: make sure that the values of the metadata items are sensible and are in plain text (no TeX! -- for \sqrt{s} use sqrt(s) -- this will show with extra quote marks in the draft version but is okay).
