The signal efficiency is estimated using simulation, considering both 
the $\rm{q}\bar{\rm{q}}\to\WW$ and $\mathrm{gg} \to \WW$ processes. 
Correction factors for the lepton reconstruction and identification
efficiency are determined using $\dyll$ events~\cite{wzxs} recorded with
dedicated unbiased triggers.
These factors depend on the lepton $\pt$ 
and $|\eta|$ and are typically around 0.96 for electrons and 0.98 for muons.
The trigger efficiency for signal events is measured to be approximately 98\%
for both $\rm{q}\bar{\rm{q}}\to\WW$ and $\mathrm{gg} \to \WW$ final states.

The uncertainties on lepton momentum scale and resolution, 
$\met$ modeling and jet energy scale are applied to the reconstructed objects in 
simulated events by smearing and scaling the relevant observables and propagating 
the effects to the kinematic variables used in the analysis. 
The uncertainty assigned to the pile-up corresponds to shifting the mean number
of pile-up events per beam crossing up and down by one interaction, and amounts to $2.3\%$.

The uncertainty on the acceptance due to variations in the parton distribution functions and the
value of $\alpha_{s}$ was found to be 2.3\% by following the {\sc pdf4lhc} prescription
~\cite{PDF4LHC,LHCHiggsCrossSectionWorkingGroup:2011ti}. 
The effect of higher-order corrections was found to be 1.5\% by varying the QCD renormalisation 
($\mu_R$) and factorisation ($\mu_F$) scales using the \textsc{mcfm} program~\cite{MCFM}.

The $\WW$ jet veto efficiencies in data are estimated from simulation, and multiplied by a 
data-to-simulation scale factor derived from $\dyll$ events in the $\Z$ peak: 
$\epsilon_{\WW}^{\rm data} = \epsilon_{\WW}^{\rm MC} \times \epsilon_{\Z}^{\rm data}/\epsilon_{\Z}^{\rm MC}.$
The uncertainty is thus factorized into the uncertainty on the $\Z$ efficiency in data and the
uncertainty on the ratio of the $\WW$ efficiency to the \Z\ efficiency in simulation
($\epsilon_{\WW}^{\rm MC}/\epsilon_{\Z}^{\rm MC}$). The former, which is statistically dominated, 
is 0.3\%. Theoretical uncertainties due to higher order corrections contribute most to the 
WW/Z efficiency ratio uncertainty, which is estimated to be 4.6\% for $\WW$ production. The 
data-to-simulation correction factor is found to be close to one.

The uncertainties on the $\Wjets$ and top background predictions 
are 36\% and 15\%, respectively, as described in Section~\ref{sec:backgrounds}. 

The theoretical uncertainties on the $\WZ$ and $\ZZ$ cross sections are calculated 
by varying the QCD renormalisation ($\mu_R$) and factorisation ($\mu_F$) scales using 
the \textsc{mcfm} program~\cite{MCFM}. The effect of variations in the parton distribution 
functions and the value of $\alpha_{s}$ on the predicted cross sections were derived 
by following the same prescription as for the signal acceptance.
Including the experimental uncertainties gives a systematic uncertainty of around 10\%.
The total uncertainty on the background estimations is about 13\%, which is dominated by 
the systematic uncertainties on the normalisation of the top quark and $\Wjets$ 
backgrounds. The luminosity measurement uncertainty is $4.4\%$~\cite{lumiPAS}.

A summary of the uncertainties taken into account in this analysis is given in
Table~\ref{tab:wwSystematics}.
