\section{Physics objects reconstruction}
\label{sec:reco}
\label{sec:firstStep}
% ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ----
The study of the $WV\gamma$ final state involves reconstruction of variety of physics object - electrons, muons missing transverse energy, jets and photons. 
In this section we describe in details the all physics objects involved in the analysis. 


The analysis relies on the standard reconstruction algorithms
produced by the CMS community. Event data is reconstructed using the 
particle-flow (PF) reconstruction technique~\cite{pflow}. Particle flow 
attempts to reconstruct all stable particles in an event by combining 
information from all sub-detectors. The algorithm categorizes all particles 
into the following five types: muons, electrons, photons, charged and 
neutral hadrons. The list of reconstructed particles is used as the set of
inputs for a jet clustering algorithm to create particle-flow jets.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Electron selection}
\label{sec:electron_cuts}

Electrons are reconstructed using a gaussian-sum filter (GSF)
algorithm \cite{CMS-PAS-EGM-10-004}, and are required to pass electron
ID cuts according to a multi-variate identification
technique~\cite{cite:elemva}.  We also require that selected
electron candidates are isolated. Particle flow-based relative
isolation is defined as
%%%
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{RelIso_{\mathrm{PF}}} = \frac{I_{\mathrm{CH}}+max(0,I_{\mathrm{NH}}+I_{\mathrm{PHOTON}}-(\mathrm{EA}\cdot\rho))}{E_\mathrm{T}},
\end{equation*}
%%%
where $I_{\mathrm{CH}}$, $I_{\mathrm{NH}}$ and $I_{\mathrm{PHOTON}}$
are the charged hadron, neutral hadron and photon isolation variables
(using an isolation cone of 0.3). The $I_{\mathrm{CH}}$ variable is calculated from charged hadrons, associated to the primary vertex.
The neutral hadron and photon isolation variables are corrected for
contributions from pile-up using the effective area correction \cite{EAcorrElectrons},
$(\mathrm{EA}\cdot\rho)$, where $\mathrm{EA}$ is the cone effective area
and $\rho$ is the average neutral particle density of the event.

The ID and isolation cuts used are shown in Table~\ref{tab:EleID} and
have been tuned by Egamma POG to give the same efficiency bin-by-bin with respect to
the working point (WP) used for 2011 analysis.

Additionally, we require
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{itemize}
\item Electron $E_\mathrm{T} > 30\,\mathrm{GeV}$.
\item Pseudorapidity $|\eta| < 2.5$. There is an exclusion range due
        to the ECAL barrel-endcap transition region, defined by
        $1.4442 < |\eta_{\mathrm{sc}}| < 1.566$, where
        $\eta_{\mathrm{sc}}$ is the pseudorapidity of the ECAL
        supercluster.
%\item Impact parameter: We cut on the absolute value of the impact
%       parameter calculated with respect to the average primary vertex (PV). We
%       require: $d_0(\mathrm{PV}) < 0.02\,\mathrm{cm}.$

%\item In order to make sure that the selected electron and the selected
%jets come from the same hard interaction and not from pile up events,
%we require that the $z$ coordinate of the PV of the event and the $z$
%coordinate of the electron's vertex lie within a distance of
%less than $0.1~\mathrm{cm}$.


\item
In order to reject events in which the electron candidate actually
originates from a conversion of a photon into an $e^{+}e^{-}$ pair, we
use an approach using the vertex fit probability of fully
reconstructed conversions combined with the requirement that the
number of missed inner tracker layers of the electron track must be
exactly zero (i.e. there are no missed layers before the first hit of
the electron track from the beam line).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Muon selection}
\label{sec:muon_cuts}

Muon candidates are identified by two different
algorithms~\cite{MUONPAS}: one proceeds from the inner tracker outwards,
the other one starts from tracks measured in the muon chambers and matches
and combines them with tracks reconstructed in the inner tracker.
These selection criteria\cite{muonIDtwiki} are summarized below:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{itemize}
\item The muon candidate is reconstructed both as a global muon and
as a tracker muon.
\item Number of pixel hits of the Tracker track $\ge 1$;
\item Number of muon system hits of the Global track $\ge 1$;
\item Normalized $\chi^{2}$ of the Global track $< 10.0$.
\item Muon $p_{\mathrm{T}} > 25\,\mathrm{GeV}$.
\item Pseudorapidity $|\eta| < 2.1$.
\item Impact parameter: We cut on the absolute value of the impact
parameter calculated with respect to the primary vertex. We require:
$d_0(\mathrm{PV}) < 0.02\,\mathrm{cm}.$
\item In order to make sure that the selected muon and the selected
jets come from the same hard interaction and not from pile up events,
we require that the $z$ coordinate of the PV of the event and the $z$
coordinate of the muon's inner track vertex lie within a distance of
less than 0.5~cm.
\item The number of tracker layers with hits from the muon track has to be
$N_{\mathrm{layers}} > 5$.
\end{itemize}

The selected muon candidates also have to be isolated. Particle
flow-based relative isolation for muons is defined as
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{RelIso_{\mathrm{PF}}} = \frac{I_{\mathrm{CH}}+max(0,I_{\mathrm{NH}}+I_{\mathrm{PHOTON}}-(0.5~{p}_{T}^\mathrm{sumPU}))}{p_\mathrm{T}},
\end{equation*}

where $I_{\mathrm{CH}}$, $I_{\mathrm{NH}}$ and $I_{\mathrm{PHOTON}}$
are the charged hadron, neutral hadron and photon isolation variables
(using an isolation cone of 0.4). The charged hadron isolation variable uses tracks from the primary vertices only. 
The neutral hadron and photon isolation variables are corrected for
contributions from pile-up using the DeltaBeta correction, $(0.5
p_T^\mathrm{sumPU})$. We require the muon to have
$\mathrm{RelIso_{\mathrm{PF}}} < 0.12$ in order to be considered
isolated.


\subsubsection{Loose Electron}
For the purposes of rejecting events with more than one lepton we
define a loose electron, which has looser cuts. We consider electrons
which have $p_{\mathrm{T}} > 20\,\mathrm{GeV}/c$, $|\eta| < 2.5$,
and which satisfy electron $\mathrm{RelIso_{\mathrm{PF}}}$ and MVA ID
cuts. The cut values for the electron ID and isolation used in the
analysis can be found in Table~\ref{tab:EleID}.
%As in the case of the
%tight electrons, we also require $d_0(\mathrm{PV}) <
%0.02\,\mathrm{cm}$ and that the $z$ coordinate of the PV of the event
%and the $z$ coordinate of the electron's vertex lie within a distance
%of less than $0.1~\mathrm{cm}$.

\subsubsection{Loose Muon}
Additionally, to reject events with more than one lepton, we define a
loose muon, which has looser cuts. We consider all global muons which
have $p_{\mathrm{T}} > 10\,\mathrm{GeV}/c$, $|\eta| < 2.5$, and
$\mathrm{RelIso_{\mathrm{PF}}} < 0.2$ to be loose muons.

\subsection{Jet selection}
\label{sec:firstStep_jets}
Jets are reconstructed with the anti-KT algorithm \cite{cacciari},
starting from the set of objects reconstructed by the particle
flow \cite{pflow,CMS-PAS-JME-10-003,CMS-PAS-PFT-10-002}.
Jets are corrected such that the measured energy of the jet
correctly reproduces the energy of the initial particle.
The CMS standard L2 (relative) correction makes the jet response flat in $\eta$.
The standard L3 (absolute) correction brings the jet closer to the $\PT$ of
a matched generated jet created using generator level input and a similar
jet clustering algorithm.
The L2 and L3 corrections are calculated using Monte Carlo, and thus a
L2L3 residual correction is applied that fixes the discrepancies between
Monte Carlo and data~\cite{newjes-cms}.
In this analysis we use jets with measured (corrected) $\PT$
greater than 30~$\gev$.
We require $|\eta| < 2.4$ so that the jets fall within the
tracker acceptance.  Jets from pile-up are identified and removed with PileupJetID tool ~\cite{cite:PileupJetID}.

Jets are required to pass a set of loose identification
criteria; this requirement eliminates jets originating from or being seeded by
noisy channels in the calorimeter~\cite{Chatrchyan:2009hy}:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{itemize}
\item Fraction of energy due to neutral hadrons $<$ 0.99.
\item Fraction of energy due to neutral EM deposits $<$ 0.99.
\item Number of constituents $>$ 1.
\item Number of charged hadrons candidates $>$ 0.
\item Fraction of energy due to charged hadrons candidates $>$ 0.
\item Fraction of energy due to charged EM deposits $<$ 0.99.
\end{itemize}
%%%%%%%%%%
All energy fractions are calculated from uncorrected jets.

\par
In order to account for electron and muon objects that
have been reconstructed as jets, we remove from the jet
collection any jet that falls within a
cone of radius $R= 0.3$ of a loose electron or a loose muon.
This ``cleaning'' procedure is applied in order to ensure that the same
particle is not double counted as two different physics objects.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Missing Transverse Energy (\MET)}
\label{sec:MET}
An accurate \MET measurement is essential for distinguishing
the $\Wo$ signal from QCD backgrounds.
We use the \MET estimate provided by the Particle Flow algorithm.
PF \MET showed the best performance
among several \MET algorithms~\cite{PFMET}.
The \MET is computed as the vector sum of all PF objects.
It has energy scale correction (type 1) and also "shift" correction, which account for small misalignment of various sub-detector systems.
A good agreement is found between the \MET
distributions of $\Wln$ events in data and simulation~\cite{metPAS}.
The resolution for inclusive multi-jet samples and for
$\Wln$ events is also well reproduced by the simulation.
A relative broadening of a few percent is observed in the data compared to MC,
and has a negligible impact on the
extraction of the W yields~\cite{WZCMS:2010}.
We reject events with small opening angle between \MET and any of the two leading jest ($\Delat\phi(\MET,j)<0.4$). 
This cut rejects events with fake \MET due to a mismeasured jet $p_T$.  

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Event selection}
\label{sec:evtSel}


The event should have a good primary vertex (PV). This means selecting
the primary vertex with the highest sum of $p_{T}^2$ of the tracks
associated with it and requiring it to have a number of degrees of
freedom (ndof) $\ge 4$, where ndof corresponds to the weighted sum of
the number of tracks used for the construction of the PV. In addition,
the PV must lie in the central detector region of $|z| \le 24$~cm
and $\rho \le 2$~cm around the nominal interaction point.

\par
In the electron channel, we select events that contain exactly one
tight electron candidate fulfilling the criteria described in
Section~\ref{sec:electron_cuts} and reject events that contain a
loose electron or a loose muon in addition to the tight electron.
In the muon channel, we select events that contain exactly one
tight muon candidate whose criteria are described in
Section~\ref{sec:muon_cuts} and reject events that contain an
additional loose lepton.
In both channels we require an event to have missing transverse energy
\MET in excess of 35~GeV and to have transverse mass greater than
30~GeV.  These cuts are designed to reduce the background
from QCD multijet production.

Further we require two central jets in the event with di-jet invariant mass 70<$m_{jj}$<100 GeV which corresponds to the hadronic decay of the W or Z in the signal process 
and $\Delat\eta(j,j)<1.4$ which further suppresses the $W\gamma+jets$ background. Additionally we require both jets to fail the CSV-medium b-tag requirement, which suppresses 
the $t\overline{t}\gamma$ and single top backgrounds. In the electron channel we require $|M_{e\gamma}-M_{Z}|>10$ GeV, which efficiently rejects the 
$Z+jets$ background, when one of the leptons in $e^+e^-$ pair is misreconstructed as photon. 


%We further require exactly two jets passing the cuts
%described in Section~\ref{sec:firstStep_jets}.


\section{Lepton reconstruction, selection and trigger efficiencies}\label{sec:Eff}

Since the lepton reconstruction, selection, and trigger efficiencies can be slightly different between data and simulation,
correction factors have to be applied to the MC to account for these differences. The efficiencies are calculated using a Tag and Probe
technique exploiting Z boson decays to a pair of electrons or muons, respectively. One of the leptons is used as tag and has to pass a
tight selection, while the second one is used as probe if the tag-probe pair combines to the Z boson mass. The total lepton efficiency
can be factorized into three components:

\begin{equation}
\epsilon_{\textnormal{total}}=\epsilon_{\textnormal{Reco}}\cdot\epsilon_{\textnormal{Id}}\cdot\epsilon_{\textnormal{HLT}}
\end{equation}

The tag and probe method is nearly the same compared to the one already used in the 2011 data analysis for this Higgs search
(\cite{CMS-AN-12-029},\cite{CMS-AN-2012-021}). Therefore, only the most important information will be discussed.

\subsection{Electron efficiencies}\label{subsec:EffEle}
In the electron case, the reconstruction efficiency $\epsilon_{\textnormal{Reco}}$ characterizes the transition from a supercluster in the
electromagnetic calorimeter to a reconstructed Particle Flow electron. The ability of a reconstructed electron to pass the offline
selection, consisting of several isolation and identification criteria, is given by the identification efficiency $\epsilon_{\textnormal{Id}}$.
Finally, the selected electron has a certain probability to fire the high level trigger and the efficiency to fulfill the HLT requirements
is parametrized as $\epsilon_{\textnormal{HLT}}$. In data, a single electron trigger is used at HLT level, while in MC the HLT requirements are dropped. \\
Since the HLT efficiency is MC is equal to $100\%$, the HLT efficiency measured on data is applied directly in the analysis of MC samples,
while the other two efficiency components are calculated both for data and MC, so that a data/MC scale factor is applied in the other cases. \\
In general, since the efficiency depends both on $\pt$ and $\eta$ of the electron, the measurement is binned in $\pt$ as (30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 200)\GeVc
and in $\eta$ as (-2.5, -1.5, 0.0, 1.5, 2.5) of the probe electron. The resulting efficiencies and scale factors are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:eleEff} and
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:eleEff}.

\subsection{Muon efficiencies}\label{subsec:EffMu}

In the muon case, the reconstruction efficiency $\epsilon_{\textnormal{Reco}}$ describes the ability to reconstruct a Particle Flow muon starting with
a particle track and can be assumed to be one \cite{MUONPAS}. The identification efficiency $\epsilon_{\textnormal{Id}}$ gives an estimate for a
reconstructed muon to pass the offline selection criteria. It can be computed for both data and simulation and thus a scale factor,
the ratio of the two efficiencies, is derived. \\
The trigger efficiency $\epsilon_{\textnormal{HLT}}$  is the fraction of selected muons fulfilling the HLT requirements, and, since the HLT
requirement is dropped on the MC analysis, the efficiency computed on data is used directly to correct the MC event expectation.\\
The efficiency measurement is binned both in $\pt$ and $\eta$ of the probe muon covering the
relevant intervals (25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 200)\GeVc in $\pt$ and (-2.1, -1.5, -1.0, -0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.1) in $\eta$. The resulting selection
and trigger efficiencies and scale factors are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:muonEff} and Figure~\ref{fig:muonEff}.
