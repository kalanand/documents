So far the SM of particle physics describes the majority of high-energy
experimental data~\cite{Beringer:1900zz}. The $W^{+}W^{-}$ and 
$W^{\pm}Z$ cross-section has been precisely measured at LHC and is well
described by the SM expectation. Our analysis extends it to include 
$W^{+}W^{-}$ and $W^{\pm}Z$ events with energetic photons in order to 
probe the modelling of electromagnetic radiation in the $W^{+}W^{-}$ 
and $W^{\pm}Z$  pair creation processes, although these channels have 
very small predicted cross sections. Previous measurements of three 
vector boson production, when at least two bosons are massive, was 
perfomed by LEP2~\cite{wwaLEP:1999}, restricting the analysis to 
$W^{+}W^{-}\gamma$. 

Here we aim to observe the first three boson prodution of 
$WW(WZ)\gamma$ with a cross section substantially smaller than that of
$WW(WZ)$. This is a very difficult cross section to measure due to very
low statistics and large systematic and statistical uncertainties. 

On the other hand, $W^{+}W^{-}\gamma$ and $W^{\pm}Z\gamma$ final states
may be sensitive to anomalous contributions to the SM's 
$W^{+}W^{-}\gamma\gamma$ and  $W^{+}W^{-}Z\gamma$ quartic couplings. 
Quartic gauge boson couplings can be probed in final states with three
vector bosons produced, as well as through vector boson fusion mediated
reactions. These final states are both kinematically reacheable at LHC.

The structure of the trilinear and quartic gauge boson couplings 
emerges naturally from the SM non-abelian $SU(2)_{L}\otimes U(1)_{Y}$ 
gauge symmetry~\cite{burgess2007}. Their vertices have a common origin 
and possess a universal strength. Together with triple gauge 
boson couplings (TGC), $W^{+}W^{-}\gamma$ and $W^{+}W^{-}Z$, the SM 
predicts the existence of four quartic gauge couplings (QGC), 
$W^{+}W^{-}W^{+}W^{-}$, $W^{+}W^{-}ZZ$, $W^{+}W^{-}Z\gamma$ and 
$W^{+}W^{-}\gamma\gamma$. These couplings are expected to play a 
significant role at LHC energies~\cite{Belyaev:1998ih}. What scarce 
experimental information currently exists on QGC comes from
the LEP experiment~\cite{ALEPH:2005aa},
where phase space limitations have constrained couplings involving 
photons in the final state. At LEP2,  $e^{+}e^{-}\to W^{+}W^{-}$ and 
$e^{+}e^{-}\to W^{+}W^{-}\gamma$ final states have been used to infer 
the SM triple couplings $WWZ$ and $WW\gamma$, as well as the SM quartic
$WW\gamma\gamma$ and $WWZ\gamma$ ones, respectively. To date there is 
no direct experimental confirmation of the existence of quartic 
couplings. QGC measurements may be probed at several
colliders~\cite{Belanger:1992qh,Eboli:1993wg,Eboli:1995gv,Eboli:2000ad,
Bosonic:2004PRD,Yang:2012vv,Ye:2013psa}. The study of these interactions can either confirm SM 
predictions or give some hint on the existence of new phenomena at a 
higher energy scale~\cite{aihara1996}. Possible new physics, expressed
in a model independent way by high-dimensional effective 
operators~\cite{500GeVNLC, Belanger:1999, Bosonic:2004PRD, 
Eboli:2006wa}, leads to anomalous triple (aTGC) or quartic (aQGC) gauge
boson couplings. Nevertheless, no deviations from the SM predictions 
have been found~\cite{ALEPH:2005aa}. Recently, a direct stringent limit on
the anomalous $W^{+}W^{-}\gamma\gamma$ quartic coupling was obtained by
the Foward Physics CMS Group~\cite{CMS-PAS-FSQ-12-010}.

The triple gauge boson production channels cover some important issues 
of EW physics at the LHC (e.g. the precise measurement of electroweak 
parameters, gauge boson self interactions, and the mechanism of 
spontaneous symmetry breaking.) Within the framework of the SM, gauge 
boson self-interactions are completely determined by the 
$SU(2)_{L} \otimes U(1)_{Y}$ gauge symmetry; thus, direct investigation
of gauge boson self-interactions provides a crucial test on the gauge 
structure of the SM. Moreover, since the longitudinal components of 
$W^\pm$ and $Z^0$ result from the spontaneous symmetry breaking, these 
kinds of studies may also be important to explore the electroweak 
symmetry breaking (EWSB) mechanisms. In the past, due to the 
insufficient center-of-mass energy, we were not able to probe these 
kinds of channels; however, with the accumulation of LHC data, it is 
now worth trying to analyze these channels.

So far, we have yet to observe any significant deviation from the SM; 
however, there are many reasons to expect new physics beyond the SM to
appear at the LHC (TeV) energy scale (e.g. the demand for dark matter 
candidates and the quest to understand large hierarchy between the 
electroweak and Planck scales.) Further confirmation of the SM or 
uncovering new physics beyond the SM thus become urgent goals for both 
theorists and experimentalists at the LHC era. For the triple gauge 
boson associated production, which is of our interest in this paper, 
extra contributions other than the SM predictions can be induced by 
possible new physics expressed in a model independent way by 
high-dimensional operators which lead to anomalous triple or quartic 
gauge boson couplings (aTGCs or aQGCs). 

Both aTGCs and aQGCs are included in triple boson production processes;
however, compared with the gauge boson pair production channel for TGCs
measurement, triple gauge boson production is more compatible for 
probing aQGCs. As in the cases discussed in 
Ref.~\cite{500GeVNLC,Bosonic:2004PRD}, it is possible the QGCs deviate 
from the SM prediction while the TGCs do not, assuming for example that
the exchange of extra heavy bosons generates tree-level contributions 
to four gauge boson couplings while the effect on the triple gauge 
vertex appears only at one-loop and is consequently suppressed. 
Assuming the aTGC contribution can be neglected, in this paper we test 
the so called "genuine quartic couplings" which just contribute to 
quartrilinear couplings.
