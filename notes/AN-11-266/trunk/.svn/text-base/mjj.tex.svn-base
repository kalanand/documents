The dijet invariant mass distribution for the sum of electron 
and muon events is shown after a fit of the sum of the Standard 
Model contributions to data in Figure~\ref{fig:CombinedFit}. 
Figure~\ref{fig:CombinedFitSubtracted} shows the distribution 
after subtraction of fitted background components obtained in 
Figure~\ref{fig:CombinedFit}.
Similar plots from separate fit to muon and electron data are shown in 
Figures~\ref{fig:MuFit}--\ref{fig:MuFitSubtracted} and 
Figures~\ref{fig:EleFit}--\ref{fig:EleFitSubtracted} 
respectively.
