\section{Injection of new physics models}
\label{sec:NewPhysics}
In looking at possible signal models, we have chosen three that we
believe will be representative of many models.  These are a
technicolor $\rho_T \ra \Wo\pi_T$~\cite{Eichten:2011sh}, a leptophobic $\Zo^\prime
\ra jj~$\cite{Buckley:2011vc}, and a Standard Model Higgs produced in
association with a \Wo\ or \Zo.  This gives us a scalar resonance, a
pseudo-scalar resonance, and a vector resonance, as well as one that
additionally should have a peak in the four body mass. The cross-sections
and efficiency numbers are given in Table~\ref{tab:signals}.

 The dijet mass spectrum for a Higgs and a leptophobic $\Zo^{\prime}$
are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:NewPhysicsMjj}. The dijet and W$jj$ spectra
for the technicolor model are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:tc}.

\subsection{WH/ZH}
These events were generated using Pythia using the Z2 tune and
standard pileup.  The details of the Pythia configuration are
\begin{verbatim}
  MSEL=0
  24:ALLOFF
  24:ONIFANY 13 11
  23:ALLOFF
  23:ONIFANY 11 13
  MSUB(24)=1
  MSUB(26)=1
  PMAS(25,1)=150.0
\end{verbatim}
Using this configuration, we generated 50k events with standard CMSSW
tools.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{$\Zo^\prime$}{Z-prime}}
For a leptophobic $\Zo^\prime$, 50k events were generated via MadGraph
in LHE format and provided to us~\cite{BuckleyMC},
\cite{Buckley:2011vc}.  These events were processed using the standard
CMSSW tools.

\subsection{Attempt to understand jet flavor expectation in these models}
The technicolor model provided by "ELM" has
arbitrarily selected coupling constants for the mixing
between techni-$\pi^0$ and techni-$\pi^{0'}$.
%%
%% ``Thanks to Steve for pointing this out to us.''
%%
We therefore list here the branching ratios of the techni-color
particles used in this model.
\par
The techni-$\pi^+$  decays to heavy flavor with
BR=81\%  but cannot decay to gluons.
The techni-$\pi^0$  decays to heavy flavor
with BR=87\%  and again cannot decay to gluons.
The techni-$\pi^{0'}$ decays to heavy flavor
with BR=49\% and decays to a gluon pair with
BR=44\%. The mixing is such that the techni-$\pi^{0'}$
component is small.

\par
This explains the loss of efficiency
by a factor of 2/3 when applying an anti-$b$-tag and another
big loss when applying a quark-gluon likelihood cut.

The detailed tables of the branching ratio for
each technicolor particle, generated by Pythia, are printed below:

The Z' signal doesn't suffer from heavy flavor or gluon contamination
because it decays most frequently to light flavor qqbar pairs (Matt Buckley/
Dan Hooper model has $pp\to WZ' \to Wjj$). The WH sample has a
significant fraction of heavy flavor because the Higgs boson couples
mostly to $b\bar{b}$. Therefore, we do not apply an anti-$b$-tag or
quark-gluon likelihood cut, because such a cut would discriminate
against technicolor- and WH-type signals.
