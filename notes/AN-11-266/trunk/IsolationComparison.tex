\section{Isolation Comparison Study}
\label{sec:IsolationStudy}

In order to check that the definition of isolation (Sections.~\ref{sec:electron_cuts},~\ref{sec:muon_cuts})
as well as the subsequent pileup corrections is robust we compare the $M_jj$ 
shapes between Data and Monte Carlo. The results are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:IsoComp}.
The discrepancies are covered by the trigger efficiency corrections and the
associated 2\% systematic (Section.~\ref{sec:LeptonSelectionAndTriggerEfficiency})
