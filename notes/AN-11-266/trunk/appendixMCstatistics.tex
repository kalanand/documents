\section{Effect of the small size of W+jets MC sample on its shape}
A limited amount of W$jj$ Monte Carlo (less than $2x$ the data) is a
major source of systematic uncertainty. In order to estimate the
associated error we use the $m_{jj}$ shape from the MC to generate
$1000$ toy datasets and repeat the fit using each one of them as a
template. Note that the event counts in each bin are allowed to
fluctuate independently along a Gaussian with mean and error given by
the original dataset. A comparison between the results using the
original template and the $1K$ fits using the Toy MC are provided in
Table~\ref{table:WjjMCSystResults}, while fits to the extracted yields
are displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:WjjMCSystFit}. Since the uncertainty
on the yields is a combination of systematics as well as statistics we
extract the error associated with limited Monte Carlo via
$\sigma^2_{Tot}=\sigma^2_{stat}+\sigma^2_{MCsyst}$.

%%The resultant uncertainty is 121 events, with it's impact 
%%on the fit shown in Figure~\ref{fig:WjjMCSystError}.

\end{table}

In addition, we plan to use W+jets templates from several different Monte Carlo 
generators (\textit{e.g.,} \textit{MadGraph}, \textit{Sherpa}, 
\textit{MCFM}) to assess the overall systematics from the 
imperfect understanding of the W+jets spectrum.
We also plan to attempt other cross checks by using data-driven techniques 
(\textit{e.g.}, by constraining the template in the sidebands 
or by using a $m_{jj}$ template from Z+jets events, which have 
similar kinematics).
