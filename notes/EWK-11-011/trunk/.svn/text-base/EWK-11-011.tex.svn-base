%Author is always "The CMS Collaboration" for PAS and papers, so author, etc, below will be ignored in those cases

% >> Date
% The date is in yyyy/mm/dd format. Today has been
% redefined to match, but if the date needs to be fixed, please write it in this fashion.
% For papers and PAS, \today is taken as the date the head file (this one) was last modified according to svn: see the RCS Id string above.
% For the final version it is best to "touch" the head file to make sure it has the latest date.

% >> Abstract
% Abstract processing:
% 1. **DO NOT use \include or \input** to include the abstract: our abstract extractor will not search through other files than this one.
% 2. **DO NOT use %**                  to comment out sections of the abstract: the extractor will still grab those lines (and they won't be comments any longer!).
% 3. **DO NOT use tex macros**         in the abstract: External TeX parsers used on the abstract don't understand them.
\abstract{
We present a study of diboson production in events with a  
leptonically decaying vector boson ($W\to\ell\nu$ or $Z\to\ell\ell$, 
where $\ell=e,\mu$) and 
a hadronically decaying $W$ or $Z$ boson ($W/Z\to q\bar{q}$) in $pp$ 
collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 7~$TeV using the CMS detector. We also present results from a study of $ZZ$ diboson production in the channel where one of the $Z$-boson decays to charged leptons ($Z \rightarrow \ell\ell$, with $\ell=e,\,\mu$) while the other decays to a pair of neutrinos ($Z \rightarrow \nu\nu$).
