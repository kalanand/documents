\section{Introduction}
A primary goal of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)~\cite{lhc-paper}
experiments is to study the mechanism of electroweak symmetry
breaking, which provides mass to the W and Z bosons while the photon
remains massless. The Standard Model (SM) postulates the mechanism of
electroweak symmetry breaking with the Higgs field as a possible
explanation~\cite{Englert:1964et, Higgs:1964pj, Guralnik:1964eu}.  A
consequence of the Higgs field would be existence of the spin-zero
Higgs boson (H) with quantum numbers of the vacuum $J^{PC}= 0^{++}$.
The observation of a Higgs boson with a mass of 125
GeV~\cite{Chatrchyan:2012ufa,Aad:2012tfa} is consistent with the
theoretical constraint coming from the unitarization of WW scattering
at high
energies~\cite{Dicus:1992vj,Veltman:1976rt,Lee:1977eg,Lee:1977yc,Passarino:1990hk,Chanowitz:1985hj,Duncan:1985vj,Dicus:1986jg,Bagger:1995mk,Ballestrero:2009vw}.
However, a more complex Higgs sector is predicted by several models,
where additional Higgs-like resonances are described.  The search for
a Higgs-like boson decaying into W bosons, using the SM Higgs as a
benchmark, is therefore a way to exclude such models or restrict their
parameter space.

% However, if the Higgs sector contains a triplet field under 
% SU(2)${_\text{L}}$ the resulting Higgs bosons can have different 
% WW and ZZ couplings than the corresponding values in the SM, and 
% the ratio of the WW to ZZ couplings of the Higgs boson can be different than 
% the one in the SM~\cite{Gunion:425736}. A critical task of the LHC physics program 
% is to discover or exclude the existence of Higgs boson(s) with 
% mass below the TeV scale by probing couplings to WW and ZZ and their 
% ratio as precisely as possible in many final states.

The primary production mechanism of the Higgs boson at the LHC is
gluon fusion
(gg)~\cite{Dawson:1990zj,Spira:1995rr,Harlander:2002wh,Anastasiou:2002yz,Ravindran:2003um,
  Catani:2003zt,Aglietti:2004nj,Actis:2008ug,Anastasiou:2008tj,deFlorian:2009hc}
with a small but measurable contribution from vector boson fusion
(VBF)~\cite{Ciccolini:2007jr,Ciccolini:2007ec, Figy:2003nv,
  Arnold:2008rz, Bolzoni:2010xr, Figy:2010ct} and more rare
contributions from other processes.  The decay of the Higgs boson to
two gauge bosons provides an important discovery signature at the LHC.
For Higgs boson masses $\mH < 2\mW$ the final states contain two
photons or two weak bosons, ZZ or WW, one of which is a virtual
particle.  For $\mH \ge 2\mW$, the main final states are those with
two on-shell bosons: $\Wp\Wm$ for $2 \mW \le \mH < 2 \mZ$, and
additionally $\Zo\Zo$ for $\mH \ge 2\mZ$.

The WW channel, where one W decays leptonically and allows for
triggering the event, while the other decays hadronically, has a
larger branching fraction than the two-lepton final state and has a
reconstructable Higgs mass peak~\cite{intro2}. The main experimental
challenge is to control the large W+jets
background~\cite{ATLAS:2011ae}.  Here we present the results from data
corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.3~\fbinv collected
with the CMS detector in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 8\TeV$ at the
CERN LHC in 2012.  The results are then combined with those obtained
in 2011~\cite{HIG-12-003}, which are treated separately because of the
different data taking conditions.

\section{The CMS detector}
\label{sec:detector}
The right-handed coordinate system is used by CMS~\cite{CMS:2010} with
the origin at the nominal interaction point, the x-axis pointing to
the center of the LHC, the y-axis pointing up perpendicular to the LHC
plane, and the z-axis along the counterclockwise-beam direction. The
polar angle $\theta$ is measured from the positive z-axis and the
azimuthal angle $\phi$ is measured in the x-y plane. The
pseudorapidity is defined as $\eta = -\ln(\tan\frac{\theta}{2})$.  The
CMS detector~\cite{CMS:2010} consists of pixel and silicon-strip
trackers up to $|\eta| < 2.5$ which, together with a 3.8 Tesla
solenoid, provide a track momentum resolution of 1\% at 100\GeVnn; a
granular electromagnetic crystal-calorimeter extending up to $|\eta| <
3$ with an energy resolution of about $3\%/\sqrt{E}$
\cite{CMS-PAS-EGM-10-003}; a hadronic calorimeter extending up to
$|\eta| < 5$ with an energy resolution of $100\%/\sqrt{E}$; and an
efficient muon system capable of reconstructing and identifying muons
up to $|\eta| < 2.4$. The detector is nearly hermetic, allowing for
measurements of the missing transverse energy ($\MET$) in the event.
A two-tier trigger system selects the events for use in physics
analysis.

\section{Data and Simulation samples}
\label{sec:datamc}
We use data collected with a suite of single lepton triggers mostly
using transverse momentum (\PT) thresholds of 24\GeVnn for muons and
27\GeVnn for electrons.  Muon triggers are limited to $|\eta| < 2.4$
while electrons are triggered up to $|\eta| < 2.5$.  Simulated Monte
Carlo (MC) samples are corrected for any data-MC difference in trigger
efficiency.  The main sources of background are estimated from data.
Monte Carlo simulations are used to estimate residual contribution of
the background, and to estimate efficiency of the Higgs signal.  We
use the {\sc madgraph}~5~1.3.30~\cite{MADGRAPH} event generator and
CTEQ6L1 parton distribution functions (PDF) to simulate the W boson
and Drell-Yan production in association with up to four jets.  The
matrix element (ME) calculation is used and outgoing partons are
matched to parton showers (PS) from {\sc pythia} 6.422~\cite{PYTHIA}
tune Z2*~\cite{Collaboration:2012tb} with a matching threshold of
20\GeVnn and a dynamic factorization and renormalization scale given
by {\small $\sqrt{m^{2}_{\textnormal{W/Z}} + p^{2}_{\textnormal{T,
        W/Z}}}$}.  Top-quark pair events are also simulated using {\sc
  madgraph}~\cite{MADGRAPH}.  Single top production is modeled using
{\sc
  powheg}~1.0~\cite{Nason:2004rx,Frixione:2007vw,Alioli:2010xd,Nason:2009ai}.
Multi-jet and electroweak diboson (WW and WZ semi-leptonic decay)
processes are simulated using {\sc pythia}.  The {\sc powheg}
generator has been used to produce Higgs signal events, and the
showering has been performed with {\sc pythia}.  For this analysis,
samples with Higgs mass hypotheses ranging from 170 to 600~\GeV have
been used.  Because {\sc powheg} uses a narrow-width approximation for
the Higgs mass, the signal samples have been corrected for the Higgs
line shape using a complex pole reweighting
scheme~\cite{Kauer:2012hd,Passarino:2012ri,Campbell:2011cu,Goria:2011wa}.
We also correct the signal for the effect of interference with the SM
$\mathrm{gg \to WW}$ production process for masses between
400--600~\GeV using the method proposed in Ref~\cite{Passarino:2012ri}.
All simulated events are fully reconstructed using the standard CMS
software as used in real data.

\section{Event Reconstruction}
\label{sec:reco}

% ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- 

\subsection{Jets}
\label{sec:recojets}

Jets are reconstructed from calorimeter and tracker information using
a particle flow algorithm~\cite{PFT-09-001}, combining the information
from all CMS sub-detectors to reconstruct each particle. The anti-\kt
clustering algorithm~\cite{antikt,fastjetmanual} with distance
parameter ${\Delta R \equiv \sqrt{(\Delta\eta)^2+(\Delta\phi)^2}
  =0.5}$ is used, where $\Delta\eta$ and $\Delta\phi$ are the
differences in pseudorapidity and in azimuthal angle in radians. Jets
that overlap with isolated leptons are not considered, where the
overlap is determined by a cone around the lepton axis of radius
$\Delta R = 0.3$. Jet-energy corrections are applied to account for
the non-linear response of the calorimeters to the particle energies
and other instrumental effects~\cite{jetpas}.  These corrections are
based on in-situ measurements using dijet, $\gamma+{\rm jet}$, and
Z+jet data samples~\cite{Chatrchyan:2011ds}.  Overlapping minimum-bias
events coming from different proton-proton collisions (pile-up) and
the underlying event have an effect on jet reconstruction by
contributing additional energy to the reconstructed jets. The median
energy density due to pile-up is evaluated in each event and the
corresponding energy is subtracted from each jet~\cite{fastjet1}.  In
addition, charged-particle tracks not originating at the primary
vertex are not considered for jet clustering~\cite{Cacciari:2008gn}.
A jet quality requirement, primarily based on the energy balance
between charged and neutral hadrons in a jet, is applied to remove
misidentified jets~\cite{jetpas}.  A selection requirement
$\PT>30\GeVnn$ is applied to all jets.  Initial and final state gluon
radiation can result in one or more extra jets.  Events with two or
more jets above this threshold within the tracker acceptance
($|\eta|<2.4$) are selected for the analysis.  To control backgrounds
arising from the production and decay of top quarks we veto events with 
jets identified as being consistent with originating from a $b$ quark
based on a loose secondary vertex selection~\cite{btagpaper}.

% ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- 

\subsection{Leptons}
\label{sec:recolepton}
Muons are measured with the tracker and the muon system, within
$|\eta|<2.1$.  Electrons are detected as tracks in the tracker
pointing to energy clusters in the ECAL, within $|\eta|<2.5$,
excluding the transition region between the barrel and endcap,
$1.44<|\eta|<1.57$.  Muons (electrons) are required to have a momentum
transverse to the beam direction, \PT, greater than 25\GeVnn\
(35\GeVnn).  The lepton candidates are required to be compatible with
the primary vertex of the event, which is chosen as the vertex with
the highest $\sum \PT^2$ of its associated tracks.  According to
simulation, this requirement provides the correct assignment for the
primary vertex in more than 99\% of cases in both signal and
background events.  Charged leptons from W boson decays are required
to be isolated from other activity in the event.  To reduce the
backgrounds from the Drell-Yan and electroweak diboson purely-leptonic
decay processes, we veto the presence of any other loosely identified
lepton (of $\PT > 20\GeVnn$ for electron, 10\GeVnn for muon) in the
event.

% ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- 

\subsection{W Boson Reconstruction}
\label{sec:recoMET}
The combination of the two highest $\PT$ jets is chosen as the
hadronic W candidate.  According to simulation, in the case of 2-jet
events, the correct jet combination rate varies from 68\% for $M_H =
200$~GeV to 88\% for $M_H = 600$~GeV.  For 3-jet events, the
corresponding rates are 26\% and 84\%, respectively.  The events with
the incorrect dijet combination comprise a broad non-peaking
background in the WW mass spectrum.


The leptonic W candidate is reconstructed from the lepton plus $\MET$
system.  Therefore, an accurate $\MET$ measurement is essential for
reconstructing the full event kinematics of the WW system.  We use
$\MET$ measured in the event from the full
particle-flow~\cite{PFT-09-001} reconstruction.  The $\MET$
resolution, measured as a function of the sum $\ET$ ($\sum\ET$) of the
particle-flow objects in the event, varies from 4\% at
$\sum\ET=60\GeVnn$ to 10\% at
$\sum\ET=350\GeVnn$~\cite{Chatrchyan:2011tn}.  We require $\MET>25$
(30)\GeVnn and the $|\Delta\phi| > 0.4 (0.8)$ between the $\MET$ and
leading jet for each event in the muon (electron) data.  In addition,
the unmeasurable longitudinal component of the neutrino momentum is
reconstructed by requiring the lepton-neutrino pair to have the
invariant mass of a W boson. The ambiguity in the second-order
equation is resolved by taking the solution that yields the smallest
$|p_{\textnormal{z}}|$ value.


The transverse mass of the leptonic W candidate is defined as {\small
  $\MT \equiv
  \sqrt{2~p_\text{T}^l~\MET~(1-\cos(\phi_l-\phi_{\MET}))}$}, where
$\phi_l$ and $\phi_{\MET}$ are the azimuthal angles of the lepton and
$\MET$, respectively.  To reduce the background from processes that do
not contain $\textnormal{W}\to\ell\nu$ decays, the transverse mass
$\MT$ is required to be larger than 30\GeVnn.

\subsection{Kinematic distributions after physics object selection}
\label{sec:controlplots}
After all of the object preselections described above are performed,
the invariant mass of the dijet system ($m_{jj}$) and of the four-body
system ($m_{\ell{}\nu{}jj}$) are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:massesPlots}
for the muon dataset.  As can be seen, the main background for this
analysis is due to the production of W bosons in association with jets
(W+jets).  The requirement $65\GeVnn < m_{jj} < 95\GeVnn$, which keeps
about 80\% of the signal events, is subsequently applied in order to
reduce this background.

\section{Selection optimization}
\label{sec:mva}
To exploit the differences in kinematics between signal and
background, a likelihood discriminant is constructed that incorporates
a set of variables that best distinguishes the Higgs signal from the
W+jets background. This approach improves the expected sensitivity to
a Higgs mass hypothesis across the entire mass range, but particularly
allows one to extract a limit below $M_H=250$~\GeVnn, where the
background is all the more dominant. These variables comprise five
angles between the Higgs decay products that fully describe the Higgs
production kinematics~\cite{Gao:2010qx}, the $\PT$ and rapidity of the
WW system, and the lepton charge.

  Ref.~\cite{HIG-11-027}.

  channel with selections optimized for Higgs mass

  }
  \label{fig:mvaPlots}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

The likelihood discriminant is optimized with dedicated simulation
samples for 12 Higgs mass hypotheses (170, 180, 190, 200, 250, 300,
350, 400, 450, 500, 550, 600) \GeVnn, for each lepton flavor (e,
$\mu$) independently.  In this way, 24 different optimizations are
obtained.  For each of them, events are retained if they survive a
simple selection on the likelihood discriminant, chosen on the basis
of the expected limit for the Higgs extraction as the figure of merit.
Figure~\ref{fig:mvaPlots} shows the distribution of the discriminating
variables for muons at the preselection level.

\section{Background yields} %%% for the likelihood analysis}
\label{sec:mjjfit}

The background normalization in the signal region is extracted for
each Higgs mass hypotheses independently with an unbinned maximum
likelihood fit to the dijet invariant mass distribution $m_{jj}$ of
the two leading jets. The signal region corresponding to the W mass
window, $66\GeVnn < m_{jj} < 98\GeVnn$, is excluded from the fit.  The
background is overwhelmingly due to the W+jets production.  The W+jets
shapes are parameterized using shapes which can well describe the
simulation.  The parameterization that has been most successful in
describing the simulated W+jets spectrum is
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{F}_\text{V+jets} = erf(m_{jj};m_0,\sigma)\times\left[(m_{jj})^{-\alpha-\beta\ln(m_{jj}/\sqrt{s})}\right]\,,
\end{equation}
where the parameters $m_0$, $\sigma$, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are all
free in the fit, subject to some mild constraints from the simulation.
The normalization of the W+jets component is also a free parameter in
the fit.  The electroweak diboson, \ttbar and single top shapes are
based on simulation and their normalizations are constrained to the
theoretical predictions.  In the case of diboson backgrounds, both WW
and WZ normalizations come from the next-to-leading order predictions.
Table~\ref{tab:mjjfit} summarizes the determination of the shape and
normalization for each contributing process in the fit. Examples of
the $m_{jj}$ fit are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:mjj_mH350} for the muon
channel, with selections optimized for Higgs mass hypotheses
200\GeVnn, 350\GeVnn, and 500\GeVnn. The uncertainties in the
normalization of the V+jets component obtained from the fit are
propagated to the limit calculation as systematic uncertainties.  The
signal $m_{jj}$ distributions are shown in
figure~\ref{fig:mjj_mH350}.

\section{The four-body mass shapes}%%% for the likelihood analysis}
\label{sec:4bodymass}
For the limit extraction, the contribution of each background in the
signal region ($66\GeVnn < m_{jj} < 98\GeVnn$) is described by an
expected shape and normalization.  The four-body mass shape of the
V+jets contribution is again parameterized with a functional form
determined through simulation.  The parameters of the shape are
determined from the data spectrum in the binned likelihood fit, which
is also used to determine the exclusion limits.  In this fit the
parameters are mildly constrained based on expectations from
simulation.  The normalization of the V+jets component of the
background is taken from the $m_{jj}$ fit, with the uncertainty taken
as a systematic error.  The other background shapes are described
using simulation, and their normalizations and uncertainties are
included as nuisance parameters according to uncertainties given in
Table~\ref{tab:mjjfit}.  The $m_{\ell\nu{}jj}$ invariant mass
distribution in the signal region is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:mlvjj_mH350} for the muon channel, with selections
optimized for Higgs mass hypotheses 200\GeVnn, 350\GeVnn, and
500\GeVnn.

\section{Systematic uncertainties}
\label{sec:systematics}
Systematic uncertainties considered in this analysis are listed in
Table~\ref{tab:signalSyst}.  Because of the background dominance, the
largest source of systematic uncertainty is the shape uncertainty of
the W+jets $m_{\ell\nu jj}$ distribution described in the previous
section.  The only other uncertainty assigned to background is the
normalization uncertainty that comes from the $m_{jj}$ fit described
in Section~\ref{sec:mjjfit}.


% SIGNAL SYSTEMATICS
%%% After rescaling the transverse momentum distribution 
%%% of the Higgs boson to the HQT prediction~\cite{Bozzi:2005wk}, 
We follow the LHC Higgs Cross Section Working Group~\cite{LHCXSWG}
%%PDF4LHC~\cite{Botje:2011sn,Alekhin:2011sk,Lai:2010vv,Martin:2009iq,Ball:2011mu} 
recommendations for the uncertainties on the production cross-section
of the Higgs boson, and for PDF uncertainties propagated to the signal
acceptance within our selections.  The uncertainty in the interference
reweighting procedure described above is implemented as a shape
variation on the signal $m_{\ell\nu jj}$ distribution.
Figure~\ref{fig:sigshapeintfunc} shows an example of this variation
for a Higgs mass of 600~\GeV, for which, of all the mass hypotheses
considered, the effect is largest.

\end{figure}

The uncertainty due to luminosity is considered~\cite{lumiPAS}.
%%% as well as the one due to the measurement of the number of pile-up
%%% events in data. 
The uncertainties on the reconstruction, identification and trigger
efficiencies are extracted from the corresponding measurements,
performed with a tag-and-probe~\cite{VBTF} approach.  The uncertainty
on the jet energy measurements is accounted for by using hadronically
decaying W boson in highly pure \ttbar semi-leptonic
events~\cite{TOP-11-015}.  The uncertainty is calculated by comparing
the reconstructed hadronic W mass in a \ttbar enriched sample between
data and Monte Carlo.  We compute the systematic uncertainty in the
Higgs signal efficiency associated with the likelihood selection on
the simulation sample by using a control sample in data.  A highly
pure sample of top pair events is obtained by requiring the presence
of two extra b-tagged jets.  These events are good proxies for our
signal because in both cases the primary production mechanism is
gluon-gluon fusion and the semi-leptonic final state contains decays
of two W bosons.  We take the relative difference in efficiency
between data and simulation for top pair events after all the
selections as an estimation of systematic uncertainty in signal
efficiency.  This accounts for 10\% uncertainty in signal strength.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}
Upper limits on the SM Higgs boson production cross section have been
calculated.  We use the modified frequentist construction
CL${}_{\textrm{S}}$~\cite{CLS2, CLS, CLSasymp} with profile likelihood
as the test statistic.
%% Based on the expected normalization and shape of the $m_{\ell\nu{}jj}$ 
%% distribution, for signal and background, and the 
%% corresponding systematic uncertainties, we generate a large 
%% number of random pseudo-experiments. 
%% For each of them, the expected background distribution is generated 
%% and a likelihood ratio for signal
%% plus background is calculated.
We present 95\% exclusion limits on the ratio of the production cross
section for the Higgs boson compared to the SM expectation in
Figure~\ref{fig:exclusion}.  We exclude at 95\% confidence level the
SM Higgs boson in the mass ranges xxx--yyy\GeVnn from analyzing 8 TeV
data (TBD WHEN UNBLINDED), while the median expected exclusion range
is 260--550\GeVnn.  Combining with 7 TeV results~\cite{HIG-12-003}, we
exclude the SM Higgs boson in the mass ranges zzz--www\GeVnn at 95\%
confidence level (TBD WHEN UNBLINDED), while the median expected one
becomes 170--190~\GeVnn and 210--560~\GeVnn.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:summary}
A search for the SM Higgs boson decaying into two W bosons with
semi-leptonic final state has been presented using proton-proton
collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of
19.3~\fbinv at $\sqrt{s}=8\TeV$ recorded by the CMS experiment at the
LHC.  No evidence for an additional Higgs-like boson is found and 95\%
exclusion limits on its production cross section have been obtained.
Using 8~TeV data, the Standard Model Higgs boson is excluded in the
mass ranges xxx--yyy\GeVnn at 95\% confidence level (TBD WHEN
UNBLINDED), while the median expected exclusion range is
260--550\GeVnn.  When combined with 5.0\fbinv of 7~TeV data, the
exclusion ranges expand to zzz--www\GeVnn at 95\% confidence level
(TBD WHEN UNBLINDED), while the median expected ranges become
170--190~\GeVnn and 210--560~GeV\GeVnn.
