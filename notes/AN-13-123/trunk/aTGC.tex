The Vector-Boson-Fusion(VBF) like production of EWK W+2jets events occurs via the triple-gauge couplings 
$\gamma{WW}$ and $ZWW$. In the standard model (SM), these couplings are defined up to 
an overall constant. Contributions to these couplings from new physics processes 
would affect the measured EWK W+2jets cross section~\cite{Hagiwara1987253}. An effective 
Lagrangian can be used to describe the effect of non-SM processes on the $WWV$ 
couplings, where $V$ is either $\gamma$ or $Z$. Such a Lagrangian contains a 
subset of the 14 possible terms consistent with Lorentz invariance~\cite{Hagiwara1987253}:

  where $\epsilon_{\mu\nu\lambda\rho}$ is the fully antisymmetric $\epsilon$ - tensor, 
  $W$ denotes the $W$ boson field, $V$ denotes the photon or $Z$ boson field, 
  $V_{\mu\nu}=\partial_{\mu}V_{\nu}-\partial_{\nu}V_{\mu}$, 
  $W_{\mu\nu}=\partial_{\mu}W_{\nu}-\partial_{\nu}W_{\mu}$, 
  $\tilde{V}_{\mu\nu}=1/2(\epsilon_{\mu\nu\lambda\rho}V^{\lambda\rho})$, 
  $g_{\gamma{WW}}=-e$ and $g_{ZWW}=-e\cot\theta_{w}$.  The fourteen coupling parameters of 
  the $VWW$ vertices are grouped according to their symmetries as $C$ (charge conjugation) 
  and $P$ (parity) conserving couplings ($g_{1}^{V}, {\kappa}_{V}$ and $\lambda_{V}$), 
  $C$ and $P$ violating but $CP$ conserving couplings ($g_{5}^{V}$) and $CP$ violating 
  couplings ($g_{4}^{V}, \tilde{\kappa}_{V}$ and $\tilde{\lambda}_{V}$).  In the SM all 
  couplings vanish ($g_{5}^{V}=g_{4}^{V}=\tilde{\kappa}_{V}=\tilde{\lambda}_{V}=0$) except 
  $g_{1}^{V}=\kappa_{V}=1$.  The value of $g_{1}^{\gamma}$ is fixed by the electro-magnetic 
  gauge invariance ($g_{1}^{\gamma}=1$ for on-shell photons) while the value of $g_{1}^{Z}$ 
  may differ from its SM value.  Considering the $C$ and $P$ conserving couplings 
  only, the deviations from the SM values are denoted as the {\textit{anomalous}} 
  trilinear gauge couplings (ATGCs) $\Delta g_{1}^{Z}$ $(=g_{1}^{Z}-1)$, $\Delta\kappa_{\gamma}=
  (\kappa_{\gamma}-1)$, $\Delta\kappa_{Z}=(\kappa_{Z}-1)$, $\Delta\lambda_{\gamma}$ 
  $(=\lambda_{\gamma}-0)=\lambda_{\gamma}$ and $\Delta\lambda_{Z}$ 
  $(=\lambda_{Z}-0)=\lambda_{Z}$~\cite{PhysRevD.41.2113, MCFM}.  If the ATGCs are 
  introduced in the effective Lagrangian~(\ref{eq:effLang}), their increase 
  will unphysically increase the $WW$ and $WZ$ production cross sections as the 
  center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{\hat{s}}$ of the partonic constituents approaches 
  $\Lambda$, and divergences would violate unitarity.  Divergences in the cross section 
  cancel out by introducing a form factor: 
  \begin{equation}
   \alpha(\hat{s})\rightarrow \frac{\alpha_{0}}{(1+\hat{s}/\Lambda^{2})^{2}},
   \label{eq:alpha}
  \end{equation}
  \noindent for which the anomalous coupling vanishes as $\hat{s}\rightarrow\infty$.  The 
  value of $\Lambda$ used to set anomalous coupling limits for a given coupling 
  parameter $\alpha$ is the highest value possible before the unitarity limit is 
  tighter than the coupling limits set by data. However, there is no unique 
  prescription to regulate this behavior or to apply a suppression factor, 
  because such a regularization would depend on the scale of new physics which 
  is unknown \textit{a priori}. Hence, in the present analysis we do not apply 
  any form factors or cut-off scale, $\Lambda$, for new physics.


%  Interpretation of the effective Lagrangian~(\ref{eq:effLang}), depends on the 
%  specified symmetry and particle content of the low energy theory.  In the light 
%  Higgs boson scenario, the low-energy spectrum is augmented by the Higgs boson 
%  and the new physics is described using a linear realization of the symmetry.  
%  Including the scalar Higgs doublet field, considering operators up to dimension-6 
%  only and retaining $SU(2)\times U(1)$ gauge invariance, the relations between the 
%  $C$ and $P$ conserving TGCs, $\kappa_{\gamma},\lambda$ and $g^{Z}_{1}$, then become:
%  \begin{equation}
%  \begin{array}{ccl}
%  \Delta\kappa_{Z} = \Delta g^{Z}_{1}-\Delta\kappa_{\gamma}\cdot tan^{2}\theta_{w} & \text{and} &  
%  \lambda_{Z} = \lambda_{\gamma} = \lambda, 
%  \label{eq:lep}
%  \end{array}{}
%  \end{equation}
%  where $\theta_{w}$ is the weak-mixing angle, and the coupling $\kappa_{Z}$ can 
%  be expressed via relation~(\ref{eq:lep}).  


EWK W+2jets process can be sensitive to ATGCs as it involves the trilinear $WWZ/\gamma$ vertices. The cross sections grow quickly with the increase of the absolute values of ATGCs. Moreover, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:tgcptw}, the ATGCs lead to exsesses on the hard tail in phase space, e.g. $PT_W$.

In the following, we show the sensitivity results of the EWK W+2jets processes on the ATGC $\lambda_Z$ as an example, from MC generator studies with MadGraph/MadEvent package. The preselection cuts at the parton level are set as following to mimic the analysis selection requirements in this analysis:
\begin{itemize}{
\item $p_{T}^{e,\mu} \geq 30\,$GeV, and $|\eta_{e,\mu}|<2.4$,  
\item $p_{T}^{j}>50\,$GeV, and $|\eta_{j}|<4.7$,
\item $R_{lj}>0.5$, $R_{jj}>0.5$,
\item $E_\mathrm{T} > 30GeV$,
\item $M_{jj}>2\,$TeV, and $\Delta\eta_{jj}>3.5$,
\\
moreover, we will vary $p_T^l$ further for optimization.

\end{itemize}

From Table~\ref{tabtgc}, one can see with 20~fb${}^{-1}$ of data at the 8TeV LHC, the $2\sigma$ sensitivity threshold on the ATGC $\lambda_Z$ from EWK W+2J productions is roughly near $0.05$. Note here we defined the signal as EWK W2j(ATGC)-EWK W2j(SM), and the background as EWK+QCD W2j in the SM for simiplicity. This $\lambda_Z$ result is worth than the limit(-0.038 $< \lambda_{Z} <$ 0.03) with assuming $\Delta\kappa_{\gamma}$ = 0 in the semi-leptonic WW+WZ diboson channel(AN-2012-224) by using 5$fb^{-1}$ 7TeV data.
