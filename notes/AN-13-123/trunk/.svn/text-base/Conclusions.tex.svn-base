\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}
We have studied the electroweak production
of a W boson plus 2jets with a leptonically decaying W boson(W$\to\ell\nu$, $\ell=e,\mu$).
The analyzed dataset 
corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 19.3~fb${}^{-1}$ at 
$\sqrt{s} = 8$~TeV collected by the CMS detector at the Large Hadron Collider.
With the kinematic requirements imposed in the analysis, we 
observe 1400$\pm$90(stat.)$\pm$218(syst.)$\pm$ 61(lumi.) events in muon channel and 1036$\pm$66(stat.)$\pm$183(syst.)$\pm$45(lumi.) events in electron channel for electroweak W+2jets(W$\to\ell\nu$, $\ell=e,\mu$) process, 
in agreement with the Standard Model expectation. 
The measured value of electroweak W+2jets(W$\to\ell\nu$, $\ell=e,\mu$) cross section is 
5.733 $\pm$ 0.256 (stat.) $\pm$ 0.949 (syst.) $\pm$ 0.250 (lumi.) pb, consistent 
with the Standard Model prediction of 5.873~pb with following selections in the parton level: lepton(muon or elecrtron), $p_{T}^{j} > $ 10GeV, $|\eta^{j}| < $  7.0, $m_{jj} > $ 120GeV. 
This is the first observation of the electroweak W+2jets production in a pp collider.
Generator level of Anomalous Triple-Gauge Couplings(aTGC) sensitivity study using this channel is shown in Appendix~\ref{app:atgc}. This study dones't show better sensitivity compared with other channels. 
%semi-leptonic WW+WZ diboson channel.
%We derive limits on anomalous triple gauge couplings  
%using the $p_T$ distribution of the dijet system: 
%$ -0.038 < \lambda_Z < 0.030$, 
%$ -0.111 < \Delta{\kappa_\gamma} < 0.142$.
%These limits are the most stringent at a hadron collider to-date 
%and are approaching the sensitivity of combined LEP measurements.
