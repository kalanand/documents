The systematic uncertainties were investigated by comparing
the unfolded $m_{jet}$ distribution for each systematic
variation to the nominal value, which is taken from
\PYTHIA. 

The experimental uncertainties considered include  
the jet energy scale, estimated by raising and lowering the jet energy by the measured uncertainty as a function of jet $\pt$ and $\eta$, and the jet energy and angular resolution, estimated by increasing and decreasing the jet energy, $\eta$ and $\phi$ resolution by 10\%.
The nominal value chosen is 10\%, motivated by the observed difference between data and simulation in the jet energy resolution~\cite{citeJEC}, so the up and down variations 
correspond to 20\% and 0\% additional smearing with respect to the Monte Carlo, respectively. 
We also estimate an uncertainty associated with the pile-up simulated in the MC, estimated by increasing and decreasing the minimum bias cross section by 8\%. 

As theoretical uncertainty due to the parton showering model, we conservatively estimate it by comparing unfolded \MADGRAPH to unfolded \HERWIG and assigning the difference as a systematic uncertainty.

After these effects are investigated, it is found that the dominant uncertainty is
the difference in the parton showering model. All uncertainties are included in
the measurement.
