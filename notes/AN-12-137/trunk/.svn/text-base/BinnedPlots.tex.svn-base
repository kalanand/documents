\section{$p_T$-binned Jet Mass Distribution}
\label{allPlots}


In the following, we show the unfolded data distributions for the different jet algorithms under study, comapared to the MC expectations from Madgraph and Herwig++. In all distributions, the MC is normalized to the data. The distributions are shown in the 4 $p_T$ bins defined in the main body of the document.
