Reconstruction of W and Z bosons begins with the identification
and selection of charged leptons and pfMET described in the previous 
section.  Given the unique signature of a highly boosted vector 
boson recoiling from jets, a minimal selection is sufficient to 
identify highly pure samples of V+jets events. The background is dominated by $t\bar{t}$ event (and in lower extent from sin
gle top events) in the $W$+jet topology, while in the $Z(\ell\ell)$+jet analysis the additional constraint on the di-lepton 
mass kills almost completely these backgrounds.  

Candidate \ZtoLL\ decays are reconstructed by combining 
isolated electrons and muons and requiring the dilepton invariant 
mass to satisfy $80<M_{\ell\ell}<100\GeV$.  

Candidate \WtoLN\ decays are identifed primarily by the topology
of a single isolated lepton with high $p_T$ and additional missing energy, with the selection described above.  The
transverse momentum \ptW\ and mass \mtW\ of the W candidate are obtained combining the lepton and the MET transverse four-momomenta components. We require \mtW\ $>50$ GeV,  
The jet mass analysis in $V$ plus jet event is carried on in a boosted kinematic regime, namely $p_T (V)> 120$ GeV. We further require the leading jet in the event (independently of the clustering or radius) to have $p_T>$ 125 GeV.
