\section{Optimal MVA cuts to maximize signal significance}

As we already introduced in previous section, we now train the MVA in
a Higgs mass window, which is a roughly fitted Gaussian mean
$\pm$ one sigma. The ten variables used in MVA are almost uncorrelated
and do not sculpt the four body mass distribution. We apply the MVA
output requirement just as a single cut as other cuts we are applying
for this analysis.

We optimized the likelihood on the basis of a scan over a range of MVA
cut values at discrete intervals. The figure of merit was chosen to be
the expected median exclusion limit achieved for the cut value based
on the same limit setup described in AN-12-024, and a reasonable
assumption on the systematics. The results in all cases revealed an
optimum cut value that minimized the expected limit with a resolution
better than a tenth of the signal strength excluded.

The data-MC comparison plots are shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:mva:plots-mva2j170mu} to~\ref{fig:mva:plots-mva3j600mu}.
Agreement on MVA ouput between data and MC is good in the region of
phase space where the cuts are made. The MVA output for top pair
events in data and MC indicates that the agreement is good at high MVA
values where the Higgs sits.

\section{MVA Output Distributions}
We use an almost pure top data control sample to study the systematics
on the Higgs signal efficiency due to the MVA output cut. These
semileptonic top events are selected by requiring exactly four jets in
the event, out of which two are b-tagged and the other two are
anti-btagged. To better understand the MVA ouput distributions, we
compare those distributions in top MC samples with Higgs signal MC
samples as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:mva:sigvsttbar-mva2j170} to
Fig.~\ref{fig:mva:sigvsttbar-mva2j600}.
