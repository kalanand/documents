% For papers and PAS, \today is taken as the date the head file (this one) was last modified according to svn: see the RCS Id string above.

% >> Abstract
% Abstract processing:
% 1. **DO NOT use \include or \input** to include the abstract: our abstract extractor will not search through other files than this one.
% 2. **DO NOT use %**                  to comment out sections of the abstract: the extractor will still grab those lines (and they won't be comments any longer!).
% 3. **DO NOT use tex macros**         in the abstract: External TeX parsers used on the abstract don't understand them.
\abstract{
We present a study of the multi-variate optimization
for the Higgs boson search in the H$\to$WW$\to\ell\nu jj$
final state in the gluon fusion production mechanism. 
Using a complete set of mostly uncorrelated variables 
we optimize each Higgs mass points separately to distinguish 
between the Higgs signal and the dominant W+jets background.
We also develop a data-driven technique to derive 4-body 
$m_{\ell\nu jj}$ invariant mass shape for W+jets background. 
For this we use events in the upper and lower sidebands 
of the $m_{jj}$ distribution to extract the 4-body mass 
shape for events in the signal region  
65 GeV ~$< m_{jj} <$~95 GeV. 
Using this data-driven technique we are able to keep 
the systematic uncertainties (dominated by background 
shape systematics) to within a few percent. 
This analysis note complements the documentation of the 
main analysis in AN-11/110.

% >> PDF Metadata
% Do not comment out the following hypersetup lines (metadata). They will disappear in NODRAFT mode and are needed by CDS.
% Also: make sure that the values of the metadata items are sensible and are in plain text (no TeX! -- for \sqrt{s} use sqrt(s) -- this will show with extra quote marks in the draft version but is okay).
