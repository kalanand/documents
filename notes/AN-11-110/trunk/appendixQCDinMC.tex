\section{QCD Systematics With Monte Carlo}
\label{app:QCDinMC}
Since there are not enough $QCD$ events in Monte Carlo 
passing all of the cuts, we relax some of them. Specifically, 
the new requirements are
\begin{itemize}
\item $MET>20.0$ for both muons and electrons.
\item Isolation$<0.3$ for both muons and electrons.
\item $WP80$ restrictions are removed for electrons ({\it{i.e.}}, revert 
to the $WP90$-like preselection requirement).
\end{itemize}
This approach does not alter the shapes of the $W_{mT}$ distributions (Figure~\ref{fig:QCDCutLoosening}) and provides a sufficient amount of events ($300-500$) to construct the templates. Furthermore, since the distribution in $W_{mT}$ should be the same for all processes except $QCD$, we perform a fit to the data using the $Wjj$, $QCD$ templates - Figure~\ref{fig:QCDTemplateFit} and fix the fraction of $QCD$ relative to $Wjj$. After accounting for acceptances of the above cuts these are: $\mu$ $frac_{QCD}=0.0053\pm 0.00050$, $el$ $frac_{QCD}=0.0386\pm 0.00486$.
