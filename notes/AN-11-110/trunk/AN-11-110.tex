% >> Date
% The date is in yyyy/mm/dd format. Today has been
% redefined to match, but if the date needs to be fixed, please write it in this fashion.
% For papers and PAS, \today is taken as the date the head file (this one) was last modified according to svn: see the RCS Id string above.
% For the final version it is best to "touch" the head file to make sure it has the latest date.
\date{\today}

% >> Abstract
% Abstract processing:
% 1. **DO NOT use \include or \input** to include the abstract: our abstract extractor will not search through other files than this one.
% 2. **DO NOT use %**                  to comment out sections of the abstract: the extractor will still grab those lines (and they won't be comments any longer!).
% 3. **DO NOT use tex macros**         in the abstract: External TeX parsers used on the abstract don't understand them.
\abstract{This note describes the search strategy for the Higgs boson in the H$\to$WW$\to\ell\nu jj$ final state
with the full statistics accumulated during the 2011 LHC run, at the centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=7\TeV$.}

% >> PDF Metadata
% Do not comment out the following hypersetup lines (metadata). They will disappear in NODRAFT mode and are needed by CDS.
% Also: make sure that the values of the metadata items are sensible. For APS submissions, they are automatically converted to APS keywords.
\hypersetup{%
pdfauthor={Pietro Govoni, Kalanand Mishra, Fan Yang, Ilya Osipenkov},%
pdftitle={Search for the Standard Model Higgs boson in the decay channel HToWWTolvjj},%
pdfsubject={CMS},%
pdfkeywords={CMS, physics, Higgs}}

%% **DO NOT REMOVE THE BIBLIOGRAPHY** which is located before the appendix.
%% You can take the text between here and the bibiliography as an example which you should replace with the actual text of your document.
%% If you include other TeX files, be sure to use "\input{filename}" rather than "\input filename".
%% The latter works for you, but our parser looks for the braces and will break when uploading the document.
