This study presents the search for a Standard Model Higgs boson, 
in its decay into two W bosons, 
out of which one decays hadronically and the other one decays leptonically.
The major background that contaminates the signal region is due to W+jets, 
and it is measured in a data-driven way from sidebands in the invariant mass
of the hadronically decaying W.
This allows us to keep the relative systematic uncertainties, 
which are dominated by the background shape particularly at low mass, to within
a few percent for each Higgs mass point. 
Our observed 95\% confidence level
exclusion limit for the SM Higgs boson production is in the mass range
320--420~GeV. For the mass range (170--510~GeV)
we are sensitive to production rate that is within two
times the SM cross section.
