\subsection{Analysis strategy}

Within the preselections described in Section~\ref{sec:firstStep}, 
the invariant mass spectrum of the four-body mass system is looked at,
as the place where the Higgs resonance is expected.
The two jets with the highest tranverse mometum are chosen as the candidates of the $W$ decay,
and only events where they are compatible with the $W$ mass are selected
(65~GeV~<~$m_{jj}$~<~95~GeV).
To further enhance the signal over background ratio, 
the events are required to have the lepton in the barrel ($|\eta|<2.1$),
and the two jets to be closer than 1.5 in $\eta$.

For each mass hypothesis, 
the limit on the Standard Model Higgs cross section is obtained
by fitting the four-body-mass shape with the background only
hypothesis and with the signal plus background hypothesis
within the CMS Combination Tool.
The background only hypothesis is parametrized with the sum of two exponentials,
multiplied by a turn-on curve:
\begin{equation}
  f(x)~=~\frac{1}{e^{-(x-\mu)/kT} + 1}\cdot{}e^{N}\cdot{}\exp^{-\lambda_1{}x}\cdot{}e^{-\lambda_2{}x}~,
\end{equation}
where $N$, $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ are free to float in the fit, 
and the parameters of the turn-on ($\mu$, $kT$) have been fixed to the value 
obtained with a free fit on a $m_{jj}$ sideband.

The signal hypothesis is described with a fit on the Monte Carlo shape, 
performed for each mass hypothesis independently.
