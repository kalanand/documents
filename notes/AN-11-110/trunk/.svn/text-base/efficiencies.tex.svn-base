\subsection{Computation of offline \& trigger efficiencies}
\label{sec:tpefficiencies}

We have done a study of the lepton efficiency for offline
reconstruction and selection (isolation, ID) and for online triggering
by the CMS High-level and Level-1 trigger system. The efficiencies are
computed using a ``Tag \& Probe'' technique on the Drell-Yan
Z$\to\ell\ell$ events in both data and Monte Carlo. The ratios of data
versus Monte Carlo efficiencies for various steps of lepton
reconstruction/selection are derived. If such a ratio is found to be
statistically inconsistent with unity, it is applied as a scale factor
correction to the MC samples. The trigger efficiencies are always
computed for leptons passing the offline analysis level selection
criteria. For electron data we also compute efficiency for the W
transverse mass cut ($> 50$~GeV) applied in the lowest $p_T$ single
electron trigger in most epochs of data taking. 

Additionally, we have
considered the possibility to use electron + 2 jets + missing $H_T$
trigger for which we compute factorized efficiency for the lepton leg,
jet leg, and missing $H_T$ leg. The technical details of this study can be found
in the CMS analysis note AN-2012/021.
