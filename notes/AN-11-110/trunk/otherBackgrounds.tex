The other backgrounds, top, $Z+$jets, QCD and diboson production, have
their normalizations constrained in the nominal fit.  This leads to an increase in the 
uncertainty of the $W+$jets yield.  This uncertainty is propagated to the limit setting
machinery which takes into account the uncertainties on the normalization of the various
templates.
