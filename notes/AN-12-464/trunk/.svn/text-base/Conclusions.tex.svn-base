\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}
We have studied the electroweak production 
of two heavy gauge bosons  in events 
with a leptonically decaying W boson and exactly two jets.
The analyzed dataset 
corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 5.0~fb${}^{-1}$ at 
$\sqrt{s} = 7$~TeV collected by the CMS detector at the Large Hadron Collider.
With the kinematic requirements imposed in the analysis, we 
observe 2979 $\pm$ 361 (stat) $\pm$ 402 (syst) WW+WZ events, 
in agreement with the Standard Model expectation. 
The measured value of the sum of WW and WZ cross sections is 
66.7 $\pm$ 8.1 (stat) $\pm$ 8.5 (syst) pb, consistent 
with the standard model prediction of 65.6~pb. 
This is the first observation of diboson events in 
the semi-leptonic final state in a pp collider.
We derive limits on anomalous triple gauge couplings  
using the $p_T$ distribution of the dijet system: 
$ -0.038 < \lambda_Z < 0.030$, 
$ -0.111 < \Delta{\kappa_\gamma} < 0.142$.
These limits are the most stringent at a hadron collider to-date 
and are approaching the sensitivity of combined LEP measurements.
