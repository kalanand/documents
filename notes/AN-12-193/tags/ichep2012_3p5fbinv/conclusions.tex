This study presents the search for a Standard Model Higgs boson, 
in its decay into two W bosons, 
out of which one decays hadronically and the other one decays leptonically.
The major background that contaminates the signal region is due to W+jets, 
and it is measured in a data-driven way from sidebands in the invariant mass
of the hadronically decaying W.
This allows us to keep the relative systematic uncertainties, 
which are dominated by the background shape particularly at low mass, to within
a few percent for each Higgs mass point. 
Using 8~TeV data, we exclude the Standard Model 
Higgs boson in the mass range 260--390~GeV, to a confidence level
of 95\%. When combined with 7~TeV data, the exclusion range expands to 240-450~GeV.
