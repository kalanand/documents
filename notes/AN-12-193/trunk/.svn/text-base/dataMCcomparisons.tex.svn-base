\section{Data - Monte Carlo comparisons}
\label{sec:dataMCcomparisons}
% ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ----

To assess the quality of the modeling provided by the MC simulation we
make comparisons between the MC shape, normalized to the number of
collected events in data, for the background compared to the overall
data yield after applying the event selection criteria.  We show the
distributions of various kinematic variables after applying all the
selection cuts in Figures ~\ref{fig:mu_jet_pt}-\ref{fig:mu_mjj} for
the muon+jets sample and in Figures
~\ref{fig:elec_jet_pt}-\ref{fig:elec_mjj} for the electron+jets
sample.  Eventually, Figure~\ref{fig:lep_mlvjj} shows the four-body
invariant mass, for electrons (on the left) and muons (on the right).
The MC has been been corrected for lepton reconstruction efficiency
and the trigger efficiency.  Besides the kinematics of the single
objects, we show here also the variables that are used in the MVA
discriminant that maximizes the signal-over-background ratio.  Seeing
reasonable agreement gives us confidence in the qualitative aspects of
the MC modeling.
