% 3. **DO NOT use tex macros**         in the abstract: External TeX parsers used on the abstract don't understand them.
\abstract{
A measurement of the jet mass in dijet events is presented
with \intlumi of data collected at a center of mass energy of
7 TeV by the CMS experiment at the LHC. The measurement is
corrected to the particle level, and compared to predictions
from several theoretical models. The effect of three different 
jet grooming techniques on the jet mass are investigated: 
filtering, trimming, and pruning.

% >> PDF Metadata
% Do not comment out the following hypersetup lines (metadata). They will disappear in NODRAFT mode and are needed by CDS.
% Also: make sure that the values of the metadata items are sensible and are in plain text (no TeX! -- for \sqrt{s} use sqrt(s) -- this will show with extra quote marks in the draft version but is okay).

{\bf Changes since preapproval}

\begin{itemize}
\item We switched the trigger strategy from dijet mass to average pt
  in order to avoid having average pt bins with contributions from
  samples with large weights for small numbers of events, which avoids
  unphysical fluctuations. 
\item We changed from an unphysically flat-weighted pt spectrum
for the response derivation, to using the pt-weighted spectrum.
This is to remove several biases in the jet mass distribution
at lower pt. 
\item We added a 1\% flat systematic uncertainty to the AK7 JES
uncertainties for groomed jets to account for data/MC discrepancy
of the W mass in a semileptonic top sample. 
\item We now explicitly correct for the unfolding bias with pythia6
and take the correction as an additional uncertainty. 
\end{itemize}
