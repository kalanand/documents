The systematic uncertainties were investigated by comparing
the unfolded $m_{jet}$ distribution for each systematic
variation to the nominal value, which is taken from
\PYTHIA. The effects considered are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Unfolding bias, which is estimated by comparing the closure of 
unfolding \PYTHIA simulated data with the \PYTHIA response matrix,
and comparing to the \PYTHIA truth. The first few $\pt^{AVG}$ bins
retain some kinematically-induced biases. These are explicitly
corrected, and the correction is taken as a source of systematic
uncertainty. 
\item Parton showering model, estimated by comparing unfolded data
  using response matrices from \PYTHIA and \HERWIG and assigning the
  difference as a systematic uncertainty.
\item Jet energy scale, estimated by raising and lowering the jet
  energy by the measured uncertainty as a function of jet $\pt$ and
  $\eta$.
The jet energy scale and uncertainty for AK7 jets is taken from
Ref.~\cite{jec_jinst}. An additional flat 1\% uncertainty is added in
quadrature to these uncertainties 
to account for data-to-MC differences in the $W$ mass peak
observed using the jet pruning technique in Ref.~\cite{EXO-11-006}. We
use the same uncertainties for the pruning, filtering, and trimming
here because the pruning is the most aggressive algorithm, and thus
the most discrepant between data and MC on top of the standard
ungroomed behavior. 
\item Jet energy resolution, estimated by increasing and decreasing the jet energy resolution by 10\%. 
The nominal value chosen is 10\%, so the up and down variations 
correspond to 20\% and 0\% additional smearing with respect to the Monte Carlo, respectively. 
\item Jet angular resolution, estimated by increasing and decreasing the jet $\phi$ and $\eta$ resolution by 10\%. 
The nominal value chosen is 10\%, so the up and down variations 
correspond to 20\% and 0\% additional smearing with respect to the Monte Carlo, respectively. 
\item Pileup, estimated by increasing and decreasing the minimum bias
  cross section by 8\%. 
\end{itemize}

After these effects are investigated, it is found that the dominant uncertainty is
the difference in the parton showering model. All uncertainties are included in
the measurement.
