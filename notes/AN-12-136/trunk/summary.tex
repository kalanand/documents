In summary, the particle-level differential jet mass distribution for 
anti-$k_{\mathrm{T}}$ jets with a $D$-parameter of 0.7 has
been presented, for standard jets, as well as
for jets with several grooming algorithms applied,
filtering, trimming, and pruning. 

The various MC models reasonably reproduce the observation
in the data. The improvement is better at larger jet
masses, and also at larger transverse momentum. 
Furthermore, all of the grooming techniques improve
the agreement between the various MC models, between
each other and with the observation in the data. 
The largest systematic effect is the difference in the
unfolding using different parton shower models, with
subleading, but still significant, uncertainties due to
jet energy and angular scale and resolution, and
a small contribution from pileup. 

%The behavior of the jet mass with pileup has also been
%investigated, as well as comparisons at the detector level
%between anti-$k_{\mathrm{T}}$-0.5, anti-$k_{\mathrm{T}}$-0.7,
%anti-$k_{\mathrm{T}}$-0.8, CA-0.8 and CA-1.2 jets.
