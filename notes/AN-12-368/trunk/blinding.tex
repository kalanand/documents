\section{Blinding strategy}
\label{sec:Blinding}

In the $H\rightarrow WW \rightarrow \ell{}\nu{}jj$ search the signal extraction 
is based on a 4-body invariant mass maximum-likelihood fit. The fit and the limit are done after simple
kinematical cuts (fit-analysis) or after an MVA selection (MVA-analysis).

For the fit-analysis an almost signal free sample can be obtained by relaxing the
hadronic $W$ mass selections. At this level the signal contamination is of the order of
$10^{-3}$, therefore data to MC comparisons can be safely performed.

Similarly for likelihood-based analysis where the S/B is still small.

Since the background estimation is fully data-driven (4-body mass fit on data),
the usage of data in the signal region to extract expected limits is compulsory.
Then, in order to preserve the blinding, the fit itself is performed internally by the
combination tool and the observed limit is not computed.
