We present a study of the Standard Model electroweak production

with a leptonically decaying W boson and exactly two jets.
The analyzed dataset 
corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 5.0~fb${}^{-1}$ at 
$\sqrt{s} = 7$~TeV collected by the CMS detector at the Large Hadron Collider.
The measured value of the sum of WW and WZ cross sections is 
$61.4 \pm 12.0$ (stat and syst) pb, consistent 
with the standard model prediction of 65.6~pb. 
Limits on anomalous triple gauge couplings, extracted using 
the transverse momentum of the dijet system, 
show no significant deviation with respect to the SM prediction.

\section{Introduction}
The pair production of vector bosons allows to directly 
test their self-interactions predicted by the non-Abelian 
gauge symmetry of the standard model (SM). 
Observations of anomalous couplings would be an indication of new physics.
Also, Higgs boson may decay into WW or ZZ pairs, giving rise to the same 
final state as the one that is studied in diboson production. 


In this Letter we report the first observation of diboson 
production in the semi-leptonic final state at a pp collider.
One W boson decays leptonically while the other boson 
(W or Z) decays hadronically giving rise to two energetic jets in 
the final state.
Previous measurements in this channel at the Tevatron p$\bar{\rm p}$ 
collider include the recent CDF~\cite{CDF-diboson-lvjj-2010} and 
D\0~\cite{CDF-diboson-lvjj-2010} results. 
The advantage of reconstructing WW+WZ in $\ell\nu jj$ decay mode over 
the purely leptonic final states is the larger branching fraction to jets, 
at the expense of larger backgrounds, mainly from W+jets.
Compared to the pure WW leptonic diboson decay the semi-leptonic 
process has the ability to  provide a direct handle on the boson transverse 
momentum. 
The sensitivity to very high boson $p_T$ makes this process particularly 
useful as a probe of the gauge symmetries at high energies 
where we anticipate new physics.




Our data correspond to an integrated luminosity of $5.02 \pm 0.11\fbinv$ 
collected with the CMS detector in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 7\TeV$ at
the CERN LHC in 2010 and 2011.
CMS~\cite{CMS:2010} uses a right-handed coordinate system, with the origin at the nominal
interaction point, the x-axis pointing to the center of the LHC, the y-axis pointing up
perpendicular to the LHC plane, and the z-axis along the counterclockwise-beam direction. The polar
angle $\theta$ is measured from the positive z-axis and the azimuthal angle $\phi$ is measured in
the x-y plane. The pseudorapidity is defined as $\eta = -\ln(\tan\frac{\theta}{2})$.
The CMS detector~\cite{CMS:2010} consists of pixel and silicon-strip trackers up to $|\eta| < 2.5$
which, together with a 3.8 Tesla solenoid, provide
a track momentum resolution of 1\% at 100\GeVnn; a granular electromagnetic crystal-calorimeter  
extending up to $|\eta| < 3$ with an energy resolution of about $3\%/\sqrt{E}$ 
\cite{CMS-PAS-EGM-10-003}; a hadronic
calorimeter extending up to $|\eta| < 5$ with
an energy resolution of $100\%/\sqrt{E}$; and an efficient muon system capable of reconstructing and
identifying muons up to $|\eta| < 2.4$. The detector is nearly hermetic, allowing for measurements
of the missing transverse energy ($\MET$) in the event. 
A two-tier trigger system selects the events for use in
physics analysis.



We use data collected with a suite of single lepton triggers mostly 
using transverse momentum (\PT) thresholds of 24\GeVnn for muons 
and $25-32$\GeVnn for electrons. To preferentially keep only real W
events, the single electron triggers typically also require minimum 
thresholds on $\MET$ and the
transverse mass \mt of the electron plus $\MET$ system. 
The overall trigger efficiency is about 94\% (90\%) for muon (electron) data, 
with a small dependence (within a few percent) on \PT and $\eta$. 
Simulated Monte Carlo (MC) samples are corrected for the trigger efficiency.
Although the main sources of background are estimated from data, 
Monte Carlo simulations are used to
develop and validate the methods used in the analysis. 
We use the \MADGRAPH~\cite{MADGRAPH} event
generator and CTEQ6L1 parton distribution functions to simulate the 
W boson and Drell-Yan production
in association with up to four jets at the level of matrix element (ME) 
calculation and matched to
parton showers (PS) from \PYTHIA 6.422~\cite{PYTHIA} tune 
Z2~\cite{Collaboration:2012tb} with a matching
threshold of 20\GeVnn and a dynamic factorization/renormalization scale given by
{\small $\sqrt{m^{2}_{\textnormal{W/Z}} + p^{2}_{\textnormal{T, W/Z}}}$}.
Top-quark pair events are also simulated using \MADGRAPH. 
Single top production is modeled using
\POWHEG~\cite{Nason:2004rx,Frixione:2007vw,Alioli:2010xd,Nason:2009ai}. 
Multi-jet and electroweak diboson WW and WZ 
processes are simulated using \PYTHIA. 
All MC events are fully reconstructed using the standard CMS software.






Muons are measured with the all-silicon tracker and the muon system, 
within $|\eta|<2.1$. Electrons are detected as tracks in the tracker 
pointing to energy clusters in the ECAL, within $|\eta|<2.5$, 
excluding the transition region between the barrel and endcap, 
$1.44<|\eta|<1.57$. Muons (electrons) are required to have a momentum 
transverse to the beam direction, \PT, greater than 25\GeVnn
(35\GeVnn).
To reduce the background from processes that do not contain 
$\textnormal{W}\to\ell\nu$ decays, we require that the transverse 
mass~\cite{VBTF} of the W candidate be larger than 30\GeVnn (50\GeVnn) 
in muon (electron) data.
The lepton candidates are required to be compatible with the primary 
vertex of the event, which is chosen as the vertex with highest 
$\sum \PT^2$ of its associated tracks. According to the simulation,
this requirement provides the correct assignment for the primary 
vertex in more than 99\% of cases
in both signal and background simulated events. Charged leptons from 
W boson decays are expected to
be isolated from other activity in the event.
Leptons are therefore required to be isolated from hadronic activity 
in the detector by restricting
the sum of transverse momentum or energy in the tracker, ECAL, and HCAL, 
within a surrounding cone
of $\Delta R \equiv \sqrt{(\Delta\eta)^2+(\Delta\phi)^2} <0.3$, to be 
less than 10\% of the measured
$\PT$ of the muon, or less than 5\% of the measured $\PT$ of the electron, 
where $\Delta\eta$ and
$\Delta\phi$ are the differences in pseudorapidity and in azimuthal angle 
in radians.
To reduce the backgrounds from the Drell-Yan and electroweak diboson 
purely-leptonic decay processes, we veto the presence of any other 
loosely identified lepton (of $\PT > 20\GeVnn$ for electron,
10\GeVnn for muon) in the event.


Jets are reconstructed from calorimeter and tracker information 
using a particle flow technique~\cite{PFT-09-001}. 
The anti-\kt clustering algorithm~\cite{antikt,fastjetmanual} with 
distance parameter ${\rm R=0.5}$ is used. 
Jets that overlap with isolated leptons within $\Delta R=0.3$ are 
not considered.
Jet-energy corrections are applied to account for the non-linear 
response of the calorimeters to the particle energies and other 
instrumental effects~\cite{jetpas}. 
These corrections are based on in-situ measurements using di-jet, 
$\gamma+{\rm jet}$, and Z+jet data samples~\cite{Chatrchyan:2011ds}.
Overlapping minimum-bias events coming from different proton-proton 
collisions (pile-up) and the underlying event have an effect on jet 
reconstruction by contributing additional energy to the reconstructed jets. 
The median energy density due to pile-up is evaluated in each event and the
corresponding energy is subtracted from each jet~\cite{Cacciari:2008gn}.
A jet quality requirement, primarily based on the energy balance between 
charged and neutral hadrons in a jet, is applied to remove misidentified jets. 
A selection requirement $\PT>35\GeVnn$ is applied to all jets. 
Only events with two jets above this threshold within the tracker acceptance
($|\eta|<2.4$) are selected for the analysis.
An accurate $\MET$  measurement is essential for distinguishing the 
W signal from QCD backgrounds and to reconstruct the full event 
kinematics of the WW system. 
We use $\MET$ measured in the event using the full particle-flow 
reconstruction. The $\MET$ resolution, measured as a
function of the sum $\ET$ ($\sum\ET$) of the particle-flow objects in the
event, varies from 4\% at $\sum\ET=60\GeVnn$ to 10\% at 
$\sum\ET=350\GeVnn$~\cite{Chatrchyan:2011tn}.
We require $\MET>25$ (30)\GeVnn in the event in case of muon (electron) data.





We determine the relative contribution of the known SM processes to
the observed \mjj spectrum using an unbinned maximum likelihood fit in
the range between 40~GeV and 200~GeV.  The fit is performed separately
for the electron and muon channels and for the 2-jet and 3-jet
samples since relative background compositions differ.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Table~\ref{tab:Table0} lists the SM processes included in the fit.
The normalization of the diboson WW+WZ contribution is a free
fit parameter. The normalizations of the background components
are allowed to vary within a Gaussian constraint around their central
values. For multijet events, this central value is obtained from a
separate fit to the $\met$ distribution~\cite{VBTF}, and the
constraint is driven by the corresponding fit error estimate. The
central values for all other processes are obtained from
next-to-leading order (NLO) or next-to-NLO (NNLO) calculations, and
the constraints reflects the theoretical uncertainties.  With the
exception of multijet production, the \mjj template distribution
shapes for all processes are obtained from simulation.  Multijet
events contribute when jets are misidentified as isolated
leptons. Hence their \mjj shape can be derived from data events with
lepton candidates that fail the isolation requirements.


The \mjj spectrum of the dominant W plus jets component is 
described using \MADGRAPH shape after taking into account 
the uncertainties due to the factorization/ renormalization scale 
($q$) and ME--PS matching scale $\mu$:
\begin{linenomath}
\begin{align}
\mathcal{F}_{\text{W+jets}} = \alpha &\cdot \mathcal{F}_{\text{W+jets}} (\mu_{0}^2, q'^2) + 
\beta \cdot \mathcal{F}_{\text{W+jets}} (\mu'^2, q_{0}^2) \nonumber \\ 
&+ (1-\alpha-\beta) \cdot \mathcal{F}_{\text{W+jets}} (\mu_{0}^2, q_{0}^2)\,,
\label{eqWpjetsShape}
\end{align}
\end{linenomath}
where $\mathcal{F}_{\text{W+jets}}$ denotes the \mjj shape from
simulation.  The parameters $\mu_0$ ($\mu'$) and $q_0$ ($q'$)
correspond to the default (alternative) values of $\mu$ and $q$
respectively, and fractional contributions $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are
free to vary in the fit.  We take $\mu' = 2 \mu_0$, if $\beta>0$ and
$\mu' = 0.5 \mu_0$, if $\beta<0$; similarly, $q' = 2 q_0$, if
$\alpha>0$ and $q' = 0.5 q_0$, if $\alpha<0$.

Figure~\ref{fig:Fig1}(a) shows the observed \mjj distribution for all
four channels combined, together with the fitted projections of the
contribution of various SM processes.  Figure~\ref{fig:Fig1}(b)
shows the same distribution after subtracting all SM contributions
from data except for electroweak diboson WW+WZ events.  
Figure~\ref{fig:Fig1}(c) shows the normalized
residual, \textit{i.e.}, pull distribution defined as $(\text{data} -
\text{fit})/\text{uncertainty}$.  Table~\ref{tab:yields} presents the
yields of various SM components obtained from the fit.  


We validate the fit procedure by performing pseudo-experiments.  In
each experiment, we generate the \mjj pseudo-data of the SM processes,
taking into account the correlation among the yields, and then fit
each pseudo-data sample.  The results indicate that the bias on the
diboson yield is below xx\% and that the fit understimates the yield
uncertainty slightly. These effects are corrected for in the final
result.  Uncertainties in the jet energy are estimated in a sample of
W bosons decaying hadronically in a highly pure sample of semileptonic
\ttbar\ events.  The mean and resolution of the reconstructed dijet
(\textit{i.e.,} W) mass distribution in data agree within 0.6\% with
the expectation from simulation.  A small difference in \met
resolution~\cite{Chatrchyan:2011tn} between data and simulation
affects the signal acceptance at the 0.5\% level.  
Further systematic uncertainties
are due to the uncertainty of the trigger efficiency estimates in
data, which is 1\%, and the estimate of lepton reconstruction and
selection efficiency, which is 2\%~\cite{VBTF}.  The uncertainty
in the luminosity determination is 2.2\%~\cite{lumiPAS}.
Theoretical uncertainty in acceptance computation is 3\%.
