\section{Introduction}
A primary goal of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)~\cite{lhc-paper} 
experiments is to study the
mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking where the W and Z bosons 
acquire mass while the
photon remains massless. The Standard Model (SM) postulates the
mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking with the Higgs field as a possible
explanation~\cite{Englert:1964et, Higgs:1964pj, Guralnik:1964eu}. 
A consequence of the Higgs field
would be existence of the spin-zero Higgs boson (H) with quantum numbers of the vacuum
$J^{PC}=0^{++}$. 
Indirect measurements~\cite{LEP:2010zz} and direct 
searches at TeVatron~\cite{TevHiggsLimit} 
suggest that the mass of the SM Higgs boson would most likely fall below 200\GeVnn,
with part of this range already excluded by direct searches from the 
LHC~\cite{HIG-11-032,ATLAS-CONF-2011-112}. 
However, if the Higgs sector contains a triplet field under 
SU(2)${_\text{L}}$ the resulting Higgs bosons can have different 
WW and ZZ couplings than the corresponding values in the SM, and 
the ratio of the WW to ZZ couplings of the Higgs boson can be different than 
the one in the SM~\cite{Gunion:425736}. A critical task of the LHC physics program 
is to discover or exclude the existence of Higgs boson(s) with 
mass below the TeV scale by probing couplings to WW and ZZ and their 
ratio as precisely as possible in many final states.



The primary production mechanism of the Higgs boson at the LHC is gluon fusion
(gg)~\cite{Dawson:1990zj,Spira:1995rr,Harlander:2002wh,Anastasiou:2002yz,Ravindran:2003um,
Catani:2003zt,Aglietti:2004nj,Actis:2008ug,Anastasiou:2008tj,deFlorian:2009hc} 
with a small but measurable contribution from vector boson fusion 
(VBF)~\cite{Ciccolini:2007jr,Ciccolini:2007ec,
Figy:2003nv, Arnold:2008rz, Bolzoni:2010xr, Figy:2010ct} and more 
rare contributions from other processes. 
The decay of the Higgs boson to two 
gauge bosons provides an important discovery signature at the LHC. 
For Higgs boson masses $\mH < 2\mW$ the final states contain two 
photons or two weak bosons, ZZ or WW, one of which is a virtual particle. 
For $\mH \ge 2\mW$, the main final states are those with two on-shell bosons:
$\Wp\Wm$ for $2 \mW \le \mH < 2 \mZ$, and additionally $\Zo\Zo$ for $\mH \ge 2\mZ$. 



The WW channel, where one W decays leptonically and allows for 
triggering the event, while the other decays
hadronically, has a larger branching fraction than the two-lepton final state and has a
reconstructable Higgs mass peak~\cite{intro2}. The main experimental challenge is to 
control the large W+jets background.
%%In this article we present an optimized search for the SM Higgs boson
%%decaying to two W bosons, one of which decays leptonically while the
%%other decays hadronically. 
We performed a search in this channel
previously using similar methods on 7~TeV data collected in 2011; the
results are reported in \cite{HIG-12-003}. 
The ATLAS experiment also reported a search in this channel \cite{ATLAS:2011ae}. 
Here we present the results from data corresponding to an integrated
luminosity of $5.1 \pm 0.3\fbinv$ collected with the CMS detector in
pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 8\TeV$ at the CERN LHC in 2012. These
results are presented both in isolation and in combination with our
results from 2011. No evidence for a Higgs boson is found, and limits
on the corresponding production cross section are presented for a wide
range of masses.

\section{The CMS detector}
\label{sec:detector}
The right-handed coordinate system is used by 
CMS~\cite{CMS:2010} with the origin at the nominal
interaction point, the x-axis pointing to the center of the LHC, the y-axis pointing up
perpendicular to the LHC plane, and the z-axis along the counterclockwise-beam direction. The polar
angle $\theta$ is measured from the positive z-axis and the azimuthal angle $\phi$ is measured in
the x-y plane. The pseudorapidity is defined as $\eta = -\ln(\tan\frac{\theta}{2})$.
The CMS detector~\cite{CMS:2010} consists of pixel and silicon-strip trackers up to $|\eta| < 2.5$
which, together with a 3.8 Tesla solenoid, provide
a track momentum resolution of 1\% at 100\GeVnn; a granular electromagnetic crystal-calorimeter  
extending up to $|\eta| < 3$ with an energy resolution of about $3\%/\sqrt{E}$ 
\cite{CMS-PAS-EGM-10-003}; a hadronic
calorimeter extending up to $|\eta| < 5$ with
an energy resolution of $100\%/\sqrt{E}$; and an efficient muon system capable of reconstructing and
identifying muons up to $|\eta| < 2.4$. The detector is nearly hermetic, allowing for measurements
of the missing transverse energy ($\MET$) in the event. 
A two-tier trigger system selects the events for use in
physics analysis.

\section{Data and Simulation samples}
\label{sec:datamc}
We use data collected with a suite of single lepton triggers mostly 
using transverse momentum (\PT) 
thresholds of 24\GeVnn for muons and 27\GeVnn for electrons. 
Muon triggers are limited to $|\eta| < 2.4$ while electrons 
are triggered up to $|\eta| < 2.5$.
Simulated Monte Carlo (MC) samples are
corrected for any data-MC difference in trigger efficiency.
The main sources of background are estimated from data. 
Monte Carlo simulations are used to estimate residual contribution
of the background, and to estimate efficiency of the Higgs signal.
We use the {\sc MADGRAPH}~5~1.3.30~\cite{MADGRAPH} event
generator and CTEQ6L1 parton distribution functions (PDF) 
to simulate the W boson and Drell-Yan production
in association with up to four jets. 
The matrix element (ME) calculation is used and outgoing  
partons are matched to 
parton showers (PS) from {\sc PYTHIA} 6.422~\cite{PYTHIA} tune 
Z2~\cite{Collaboration:2012tb} with a matching
threshold of 20\GeVnn and a dynamic factorization and renormalization scale given by
{\small $\sqrt{m^{2}_{\textnormal{W/Z}} + p^{2}_{\textnormal{T, W/Z}}}$}.
Top-quark pair events are also simulated using {\sc MADGRAPH}~\cite{MADGRAPH}. 
Single top production is modeled using
{\sc powheg}~1.0~\cite{Nason:2004rx,Frixione:2007vw,Alioli:2010xd,Nason:2009ai}. 
Multi-jet and electroweak diboson (WW and WZ semi-leptonic decay)
processes are simulated using {\sc PYTHIA}. 
The {\sc powheg} generator has been used to produce Higgs signal events, 
and the showering has been
performed with {\sc PYTHIA}. 
For this analysis, samples with Higgs mass hypotheses ranging
from 170 to 600\GeVnn have been used. 
All simulated events are fully reconstructed using the standard CMS
software as used in real data.

\section{Event Reconstruction}
\label{sec:reco}

% ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- 

\subsection{Jets}
\label{sec:recojets}

Jets are reconstructed from calorimeter and tracker information using
a particle flow algorithm~\cite{PFT-09-001}, combining the information
from all CMS sub-detectors to reconstruct each particle. The anti-\kt
clustering algorithm~\cite{antikt,fastjetmanual} with distance
parameter ${\Delta R \equiv \sqrt{(\Delta\eta)^2+(\Delta\phi)^2}
=0.5}$ is used, where $\Delta\eta$ and $\Delta\phi$ are the
differences in pseudorapidity and in azimuthal angle in radians. Jets
that overlap with isolated leptons are not considered, where the
overlap is determined by a cone around the lepton axis of radius
$\Delta R = 0.3$. Jet-energy corrections are applied to account for the
non-linear response of the calorimeters to the particle energies and
other instrumental effects~\cite{jetpas}.  These corrections are based
on in-situ measurements using dijet, $\gamma+{\rm jet}$, and Z+jet
data samples~\cite{Chatrchyan:2011ds}.  Overlapping minimum-bias
events coming from different proton-proton collisions (pile-up) and
the underlying event have an effect on jet reconstruction by
contributing additional energy to the reconstructed jets. The median
energy density due to pile-up is evaluated in each event and the
corresponding energy is subtracted from each jet~\cite{fastjet1}. 
In addition,
charged-particle tracks not originating at the primary vertex are not
considered for jet clustering~\cite{Cacciari:2008gn}. 
A jet quality requirement, primarily based on the energy balance 
between charged and neutral hadrons
in a jet, is applied to remove misidentified jets~\cite{jetpas}. 
A selection requirement $\PT>30\GeVnn$ is applied to all jets. 
Initial and final state gluon radiation can result in an extra jet.
Only events with two or three jets above this threshold within the 
tracker acceptance ($|\eta|<2.4$) are selected for the analysis.

% ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- 

\subsection{Leptons}
\label{sec:recolepton}
Muons are measured with the tracker and the muon system, within $|\eta|<2.1$. 
Electrons are detected as tracks in the tracker pointing to energy 
clusters in the ECAL, within $|\eta|<2.5$,  excluding the transition 
region between the barrel and endcap, $1.44<|\eta|<1.57$. 
Muons (electrons) are required to have a momentum transverse to the 
beam direction, \PT, greater than 25\GeVnn\ (35\GeVnn).
The lepton candidates are required to be compatible with the 
primary vertex of the event, which is chosen as the vertex with 
the highest $\sum \PT^2$ of its associated tracks. 
According to simulation, this requirement provides the correct 
assignment for the primary vertex in more than 99\% of cases
in both signal and background events. 
Charged leptons from W boson decays are required to
be isolated from other activity in the event.
%%Electrons (Muons) are therefore required to be isolated 
%%from hadronic activity in the detector by restricting
%%the sum of transverse momentum or energy in the tracker, 
%%ECAL, and HCAL, within a surrounding cone
%%of $\Delta R <0.3 (0.4)$, to be less than 5\% (10\%) of the measured
%%$\PT$ of the electron (muon). 
%%Before the isolation requirement is applied, pile-up energy is 
%%subtracted from the isolation cone.
To reduce the backgrounds from the Drell-Yan and electroweak 
diboson purely-leptonic decay processes, we veto the presence of 
any other loosely identified lepton (of $\PT > 20\GeVnn$ for electron,
10\GeVnn for muon) in the event.

% ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- 

\subsection{W Boson Reconstruction}
\label{sec:recoMET}
The combination of the two highest $\PT$ jets is chosen as the
hadronic W candidate.
According to simulation, in the case of 2-jet events, the 
correct jet combination rate varies from 68\% for 
$M_H = 200$~GeV to 88\% for $M_H = 600$~GeV.
For 3-jet events, the corresponding rates are 26\% and 84\%, respectively.
The events with the incorrect dijet combination comprise a broad non-peaking 
background in the WW mass spectrum.


The leptonic W candidate is reconstructed 
from the lepton plus $\MET$ system. 
Therefore, an accurate $\MET$ measurement is essential for reconstructing the
full event kinematics of the WW system. 
We use $\MET$ measured in the event from the full
particle-flow~\cite{PFT-09-001} reconstruction. 
The $\MET$ resolution, measured as a
function of the sum $\ET$ ($\sum\ET$) of the
particle-flow objects in the event, varies from 4\%
at $\sum\ET=60\GeVnn$ to 10\% at
$\sum\ET=350\GeVnn$~\cite{Chatrchyan:2011tn}.  We require $\MET>25$ 
(30)\GeVnn for each event in the muon (electron) data.  In addition,
the unmeasurable longitudinal component of the neutrino momentum is
reconstructed by requiring the lepton-neutrino pair to have the
invariant mass of a W boson. The ambiguity in the second-order
equation is resolved by taking the solution that yields the smallest
$|p_{\textnormal{z}}|$ value.


The transverse mass of the leptonic W candidate is defined as
{\small $\MT \equiv \sqrt{2~p_T^l~\MET~(1-\cos(\phi_l-\phi_{\MET}))}$}, 
where $\phi_l$ and $\phi_{\MET}$ are the azimuthal angles of the 
lepton and $\MET$, respectively.
To reduce the background from processes that do not contain
$\textnormal{W}\to\ell\nu$ decays,  
the transverse mass $\MT$ is required to  
be larger than 30\GeVnn.

\subsection{Kinematic distributions after physics object selection}
\label{sec:controlplots}
After all of the object preselections described above are performed, 
the invariant mass of the dijet system ($m_{jj}$) and of the
four-body system ($m_{\ell{}\nu{}jj}$) are shown in 
Figure~\ref{fig:massesPlots} for the muon dataset.
As can be seen, the main background for this analysis is due to 
the production of W bosons in association with jets (W+jets). 
The requirement $65\GeVnn < m_{jj} < 95\GeVnn$, which keeps about 
80\% of the signal events, is subsequently applied in
order to reduce this background.

%%%\section{Fit-based limit extraction}
%%%\label{sec:fit}
%%%A first limit extraction is performed after applying a simple set of selections on top of those
%%%already described. To help discriminate signal-like events from background contamination, we exploit
%%%the centrality of Higgs events by requiring lepton $|\eta|<1.5$, $\Delta\eta_{jj} < 1.5$, and
%%%$|\eta_{jj}| < 3$. Moreover, to reduce the contamination from \ttbar in the three-jet final state,
%%%events are discarded if one or more jets with $\PT>30\GeVnn$ and $|\eta|<2.4$ are identified to be
%%%generated from a b-quark, based on the counting of tracks with large impact parameter within
%%%jets~\cite{btag}.
%%%%TCHEM
%%%
%%%The limit extraction is based on the simultaneous fit of signal and background on the
%%%$m_{\ell{}\nu{}jj}$ mass spectrum. The signal model is derived from simulation, where the scale
%%%factors accounting from residual differences between data and simulation in lepton reconstruction,
%%%identification, and triggering are accounted for. The statistical uncertainty on the background is
%%%derived within the limit calculation from the uncertainties on the fit parameter determination.
%%%
%%%The functional form of the background is chosen on the basis of compatibility with the simulation.
%%%A set of candidate functions is inspected: polynomials ($\mathcal{T}(x;\mu,kT) \times \sum a_i x^i $),
%%%exponentials ($\mathcal{T}(x;\mu,kT) \times \sum N_i e^{-\lambda_i x}$), exponentiated polynomials
%%%($\mathcal{T}(x;\mu,kT) \times e^{\sum a_i x^i}$) and power laws
%%%($\mathcal{T}(x;\mu,kT) \times \sum N_i (x-a_i)^{-n_i}$), where all functions are multiplied by
%%%$\mathcal{T}(x;\mu,kT)$, a fermi function intended to model the low invariant mass turn-on. 
%%%
%%%For each family, a candidate is chosen by increasing the number of degrees of freedom until 
%%%the goodness of the fit does not significantly increase any more. 
%%%The resulting set is composed by a third order
%%%exponentiated polynomial, a second order exponential, and a first order power law. Since a very
%%%large number of degrees of freedom is needed for the polynomials to well reproduce the invariant
%%%mass shape, the whole family is discarded.
%%%
%%%For any of these candidates, the average difference with respect to the others after the fit on data
%%%is considered as an intrinsic bias due to the shape choice, and the functional form with smallest
%%%bias and number of degrees of freedom is chosen as the background model. Its bias is then considered
%%%as an additional systematic uncertainty in the limit extraction.
%%%
%%%% The choice of this model allows the limit extraction only where the background shows a
%%%% monotonic decrease, thus for Higgs mass hypothesis above 250\GeVnn.
%%%Figure~\ref{fig:backgroundShape} shows the four-body mass distribution of the observed events 
%%%after the preselections, overlapped to a fit of the chosen background-only shape, performed 
%%%outside the combination tool for illustrative purposes.

\section{Selection optimization}
\label{sec:mva}
To exploit the differences in kinematics between signal and
background, a likelihood discriminant is constructed that incorporates
a set of variables that best distinguishes the Higgs signal from the
W+jets background. This approach improves the expected sensitivity to
a Higgs mass hypothesis across the entire mass range, but particularly
allows one to extract a limit below $M_H=250$~\GeVnn, where the background
is all the more dominant. These variables comprise five
angles between the Higgs decay products that fully describe the Higgs
production kinematics~\cite{Gao:2010qx}, the $\PT$ and rapidity of the
WW system, and the lepton charge.

  Ref.~\cite{HIG-11-027}. 
  Also shown in addition are the likelihood discriminants for muon 
  plus 2-jet channel with selections optimized for Higgs mass 
  hypotheses of 190\GeVnn and 500\GeVnn. 
  The error bars correspond to the statistical uncertainties.

  \label{fig:mvaPlots}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

The likelihood discriminant is optimized with dedicated simulation 
samples for 12 Higgs mass hypotheses (170, 180, 190, 200, 250, 300, 350, 
400, 450, 500, 550, 600\GeVnn), for each
lepton flavor ($e$, $\mu$) and for each jet multiplicity (2 jets, 3 jets) 
independently. 
In this way, 48 different optimizations are obtained. 
For each of them, events are retained if they survive a simple 
selection on the likelihood discriminant, chosen on the basis of the 
expected limit for the Higgs extraction as the figure of merit. 
Figure~\ref{fig:mvaPlots} shows the distribution of the 
discriminating variables for muons at the preselection level.

\section{Background yields} %%% for the likelihood analysis}
\label{sec:mjjfit}

The background normalization in the signal region is extracted, for
each Higgs mass hypotheses independently, with an unbinned maximum likelihood
fit to the dijet invariant mass distribution $m_{jj}$ of the two
leading jets. The signal region corresponding to the W mass window,
$65\GeVnn < m_{jj} < 95\GeVnn$, is excluded from the fit.  The W+jets
shape is taken from simulation for Higgs mass hypotheses at or below
200\GeVnn. For higher masses the simulation doesn't have enough
events, so we describe the shape analytically using an exponential fit
function.  The overall normalization of the W+jets component is
allowed to vary in the fit.  The electroweak diboson, \ttbar, single
top, and Drell-Yan+jets shapes are based on simulation and their
normalization are constrained to the theoretical predictions, within
the corresponding uncertainties.  In case of diboson backgrounds, both
WW and WZ normalizations are constrained to the next-to-leading order
predictions within the uncertainties.  The multi-jet background shape
is derived from data by relaxing lepton isolation and identification
requirements. Its contribution to the total number of events is evaluated
from a separate two-component likelihood fit to the W transverse mass
distribution, and constrained in the $m_{jj}$ fit according to this
fraction within uncertainties.  Table~\ref{tab:mjjfit} summarizes the
determination of the shape and normalization for each contributing
process in the fit. Examples of the $m_{jj}$ fit are shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:mjj_mH350} for muon plus 2 jet channel, with selections
optimized for Higgs mass hypotheses 200\GeVnn, 300\GeVnn, and
500\GeVnn. The uncertainties in the normalization obtained from the
fit are propagated to the limit calculation as a systematic uncertainty.

\section{The four-body mass shapes}%%% for the likelihood analysis}
\label{sec:4bodymass}
For the limit extraction, the contribution of each background in the signal region
($65\GeVnn < m_{jj} < 95\GeVnn$) is described by the expected shape and normalization.

The four-body mass shape of the W+jets contribution is extracted from data as a mixture of the
shape measured in two signal-free regions, namely an upper sideband (SBH,
$95\GeVnn <m_{jj} < 115\GeVnn$ ) and a lower sideband (SBL, $55\GeVnn <m_{jj} < 65\GeVnn$):

\begin{equation}
m_{\textnormal{WW}_i}^{j} = (1-\alpha^j) \cdot m_{\textnormal{SBH}_i}^j + \alpha^j \cdot  m_{\textnormal{SBL}_i}^j~,
\label{EqnAlpha}
\end{equation}

where the index $j$ refers to each of the 48 mass spectra and 
$i$ to the bins in the four-body mass. 
The $\alpha$ factor is chosen for each Higgs mass hypotheses on 
the simulation by minimizing the $\chi^2$ between the extrapolated 
shape in the signal region and the expected one. 
The distributions of the extrapolated W+jets background in the signal 
region are shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:Wjets_dd_example} (muon 2-jet category) with selections  
optimized for Higgs mass hypotheses of 200\GeVnn, 300\GeVnn, and 500\GeVnn. 
Because of the low statistics, the shapes are regularized by
means of an exponential fit (solid curve). 
Uncertainties in the $\alpha$ factor and in the decay constant 
of the exponential are utilized to derive the systematic band.

\end{figure}

The four-body mass shape for multijet background events is obtained 
from data as well, by selecting a control sample of non-isolated 
leptons and relaxing the $\MET$ threshold and identification requirements. 
The fraction of multijet events in data
is computed from a fit to W transverse mass. 
For muons, the multijet fraction is negligible, while for 
electrons it is several percent depending on the jet multiplicity 
in the event. 
All other background categories use the $m_{\ell\nu{}jj}$
shape predicted by their respective Monte Carlo samples. The
$m_{\ell\nu{}jj}$ invariant mass distribution in the signal region is
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:mlvjj_mH350} for muon plus 2-jet channel with
selections optimized for Higgs mass hypotheses 200\GeVnn, 300\GeVnn,
and 500\GeVnn.

\section{Systematic uncertainties}
\label{sec:systematics}
Systematic uncertainties considered in this analysis are listed in 
Table~\ref{tab:signalSyst}.
Because of the background dominance,  
the largest source of systematic uncertainty is the shape 
uncertainty of the W+jets $m_{\ell\nu jj}$ distribution 
described in the previous section. 
The only other uncertainty assigned to background 
is the normalization uncertainty that 
comes from the $m_{jj}$ fit described in Section~\ref{sec:mjjfit}.


% SIGNAL SYSTEMATICS

recommendations for the uncertainties on the production cross-section
of the Higgs boson, and for PDF uncertainties propagated to the signal
acceptance within our selections. Additional uncertainties are
implemented to account for the limitation of the narrow Higgs width
approximation in the Higgs simulation and the effect of interference
with the SM backgrounds, and for the uncertainty in scale caused by
exclusive binning in 2- and 3-jet categories~(\cite{CLS2}, Appendix
C).  The uncertainty due to luminosity is considered~\cite{lumiPAS}.
%%% as well as the one due to the measurement of the number of pile-up

The uncertainties on the reconstruction, identification
and trigger efficiencies are extracted from the corresponding
measurements, performed with a tag-and-probe~\cite{VBTF} approach.  
The uncertainty on the jet energy measurements is accounted for by

Higgs signal efficiency associated with the likelihood selection

A highly pure sample of top pair events is obtained by requiring 
the presence of two extra b-tagged jets.  
These events are good proxies for 
our signal because in both cases the primary production mechanism 
is gluon-gluon 
fusion and the semi-leptonic final state contains decays of two W bosons. 
We take the relative difference in efficiency between data and simulation 
for top pair events after all the selections as an estimation of systematic 
uncertainty in signal efficiency. 
This accounts for 10\% uncertainty in signal strength.

%%%Upper limits on the SM Higgs boson cross section have been calculated with the fit-based

Upper limits on the SM Higgs boson production cross section have 
been calculated. 
We use the modified frequentist construction
CL${}_{\textrm{S}}$~\cite{CLS, CLS2} with profile likelihood as the 
test statistic. 
Based on the expected normalization and shape of the $m_{\ell\nu{}jj}$ 
distribution, for signal and background, and the 
corresponding systematic uncertainties, we generate a large 
number of random pseudo-experiments. 
For each of them, the expected background distribution is generated 
and a likelihood ratio for signal
plus background, when the signal strength is free to float or is 
fixed at a given value, is calculated. We present 95\% exclusion 
limits on the ratio of the production cross section for the 
Higgs boson compared to the SM expectation in Figure~\ref{fig:exclusion}. 
%%%On the left, the fit-based limit is shown, on the right the likelihood-based one.

%%%As a final result, 
%%%the exclusion range provided by the analysis with the most sensitive expected limit has been chosen.
We exclude at 95\% confidence level the SM Higgs boson in the mass range
$260-460\GeVnn$ from analyzing 8 TeV data.  Combining with 7 TeV
results~\cite{HIG-12-003}, we exclude the SM Higgs boson in
the mass range $230-480\GeVnn$, at 95\% confidence level.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:summary}
A search for the SM Higgs boson decaying into two W
bosons with semi-leptonic final state has been presented 
using proton-proton collision 
data corresponding to an
integrated luminosity of 5.1\fbinv at $\sqrt{s}=8\TeV$ recorded by the 
CMS experiment at the LHC.  
No evidence for the SM-like Higgs boson is found  
and 95\% exclusion limits on its production cross section have been obtained.  
Using 8~TeV data, the Standard Model Higgs boson is excluded in 
the mass range $260-460$~GeV at 95\% confidence level. 
When combined with 7~TeV data, the exclusion range
expands to $230-480$~GeV at 95\% confidence level.
%%We exclude the SM Higgs boson in the mass
%%range $320-420\GeVnn$ at 95\% confidence level. 
%%In combination with analyses of other Higgs decay
%%channels by the CMS Collaboration, these results allow the exclusion of a wide range of masses for the Higgs boson.
