\abstract{

We present a study of the lepton efficiency for offline 
reconstruction and selection (isolation, ID) and for online 
triggering by the CMS High-level and Level-1 trigger system. 
The efficiencies are computed using
a ``Tag \& Probe'' technique on the Drell-Yan Z$\to\ell\ell$ events in
both data and Monte Carlo.  
The ratios of data versus Monte Carlo efficiencies for
various steps of lepton reconstruction/selection are derived. 
If such
a ratio is found to be statistically inconsistent with unity, it is
applied as a scale factor correction to the MC samples.
The trigger efficiencies are always computed for 
leptons passing the offline analysis level selection criteria.
For electron data we also compute efficiency for 
the W transverse mass cut ($> 50$~GeV) applied in the 
lowest $p_T$ single electron trigger in most epochs of data taking.
Additionally, we have considered the possibility to use 
electron + 2 jets + missing $H_T$ trigger for which we compute 
factorized efficiency for the lepton leg, jet leg, and missing $H_T$ 
leg.
This analysis note complements the documentation of 
AN-11/110 and AN-12/008.

\section{Recap of the event selection}
\label{sec:reco}
The event selection criteria are described in detail in AN-11/110. 
Here we summarize them in brief.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Electron selection}
\label{sec:electron_cuts}
Electrons are reconstructed using a gaussian sum 
filter (GSF) algorithm \cite{CMS-PAS-EGM-10-004},
and are required to pass electron ID cuts according 
to the simple cut-based electron ID~\cite{simplecutbasedelectronid}, 
with the ``VBTF Working Point 70''. 
The GSF algorithm accounts for possible energy loss due to
bremsstrahlung in the tracker layers.
The energy of an electron candidate with $\et>30~\gev$ is essentially
determined by the ECAL cluster energy, while its momentum direction
is determined by that of the associated track.
The simple cut based electron ID relies on three shower
shape variables with different cut values for the barrel and
the endcap regions, as shown in Table~\ref{tab:EleID}.

Additionally, we require
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{itemize}
\item Electron $E_\mathrm{T} > 30\,\mathrm{GeV}$.
\item Pseudorapidity $|\eta| < 2.5$. There is an exclusion range due
        to the ECAL barrel-endcap transition region, defined by
        $1.4442 < |\eta_{\mathrm{sc}}| < 1.566$, where
        $\eta_{\mathrm{sc}}$ is the pseudorapidity of the ECAL
        supercluster.
\item Impact parameter: We cut on the absolute value of the impact
       parameter calculated with respect to the average beamspot. We
       require:  $d_0(\mathrm{Bsp}) < 0.02\,\mathrm{cm}.$   
\item The selected electron candidates have to be isolated simultaneously in
the tracker, and in the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimters.  Combined
relative isolation is defined as
%%%
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{RelIso_{\mathrm{Comb}}} = \frac{I_{\mathrm{Trk}}+I_{\mathrm{EM}}+I_{\mathrm{had}}}{E_\mathrm{T}}.
\end{equation*} 
%%%
The electron candidate is required to have 
$\mathrm{RelIso_{\mathrm{Comb}}} < 0.05$ in order 
to be considered isolated. 
A pile-up offset subtraction in the isolation cone 
using fastjet algorithm \cite{FastJetPUSubtraction} is applied.
We also veto the presence of a second loose lepton in the event.
\item 
In order to reject events in which the electron candidate actually
originates from a conversion of a photon into an $e^{+}e^{-}$ pair, we
require the number of missed inner tracker layers of the electron
track to be exactly zero (i.e. there are no missed layers before the
first hit of the electron track from the beamline). In addition, we
reject any event in which the selected electron is flagged as a
conversion, \textit{i.e.}, an electron that has a 
distance of the partner track $|$\texttt{dist}$|$ $< 0.02$~mm and an
opening angle $|$\texttt{dcot}$|$ $< 0.02$~\cite{ConversionRejection}.
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Muon selection}
\label{sec:muon_cuts}
Muon candidates are identified by two different 
algorithms~\cite{MUONPAS}: one proceeds from the inner tracker outwards, 
the other one starts from tracks measured in the muon chambers and matches 
and combines them with tracks reconstructed in the inner tracker. 
These selection criteria are summarized below:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{itemize}
\item The muon candidate is reconstructed both as a global muon and
as a tracker muon.
\item The number of hits of the muon track in the silicon tracker has
to be $N_{\mathrm{Hits}} > 10$.
\item Number of pixel hits of the Tracker track $\ge 1$;
\item Number of muon hits of the Global track $\ge 2$;
\item Normalized $\chi^{2}$ of the Global track $< 10.0$.
\item Muon $p_{\mathrm{T}} > 25\,\mathrm{GeV}$.
\item Pseudorapidity $|\eta| < 2.1$.
\item Impact parameter: We cut on the absolute value of the impact
parameter calculated with respect to the beamspot. We require:
$d_0(\mathrm{Bsp}) < 0.02\,\mathrm{cm}.$
\item In order to make sure that the selected muon and the selected
jets come from the same hard interaction and not from pile up events,
we require that the $z$ coordinate of the PV of the event and the $z$
coordinate of the muon's inner track vertex lie within a distance of
less than 1~cm.
\item The selected muon candidates also have to be isolated.
We require the muon to be isolated simultaneusly in the
tracker, and in the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters.  
The muon candidate is required to have
$\mathrm{RelIso_{\mathrm{Comb}}} < 0.1$ in order to be considered
isolated.
We also veto the presence of a second loose lepton in the event.
\end{itemize}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Jet selection}
\label{sec:firstStep_jets}
Jets are reconstructed with the anti-KT algorithm \cite{cacciari}, 
starting from the set of objects reconstructed by the particle 
flow \cite{pflow,CMS-PAS-JME-10-003,CMS-PAS-PFT-10-002}.
Jets are corrected such that the measured energy of the jet 
correctly reproduces the energy of the initial particle. 
The CMS standard L2 (relative) correction makes the jet response flat in $\eta$.
The standard L3 (absolute) correction brings the jet closer to the $\PT$ of 
a matched generated jet created using generator level input and a similar 
jet clustering algorithm.
The L2 and L3 corrections are calculated using Monte Carlo, and thus a 
L2L3 residual correction is applied that fixes the discrepancies between 
Monte Carlo and data~\cite{newjes-cms}.
In this analysis we use jets with measured (corrected) $\PT$  
greater than 30~$\gev$. 
We require $|\eta| < 2.4$ so that the jets fall within the
tracker acceptance.  
Jets are required to pass a set of loose identification
criteria; this requirement eliminates jets originating from or being seeded by
noisy channels in the calorimeter~\cite{Chatrchyan:2009hy}: 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{itemize}
\item Fraction of energy due to neutral hadrons $<$ 0.99.
\item Fraction of energy due to neutral EM deposits $<$ 0.99.
\item Number of constituents $>$ 1.
\item Number of charged hadrons candidates $>$ 0.
\item Fraction of energy due to charged hadrons candidates $>$ 0.
\item Fraction of energy due to charged EM deposits $<$ 0.99.
\end{itemize}
%%%%%%%%%%
All energy fractions are calculated from uncorrected jets.

\par
In order to account for electron and muon objects that
have been reconstructed as jets, we remove from the jet
collection any jet that falls within a
cone of radius $R= 0.3$ of a loose electron or a loose muon. 
This ``cleaning'' procedure is applied in order to ensure that the same
particle is not double counted as two different physics objects.
We require exactly two or three jets in the event.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Missing transverse energy requirement}
\label{sec:MET}
An accurate MET measurement is essential for distinguishing
the $\Wo$ signal from QCD backgrounds. 
We use the MET estimate provided by the Particle Flow algorithm.
PF MET showed the best performance
among several MET algorithms~\cite{PFMET}.
The MET is computed as the vector sum of all PF objects.
A good agreement is found between the MET
distributions of $\Wln$ events in data and simulation~\cite{metPAS}.
The resolution for inclusive multi-jet samples and for
$\Wln$ events is also well reproduced by the simulation.  
A relative broadening of a few percent is observed in the data compared to MC,  
and has a negligible impact on the
extraction of the W yields~\cite{WZCMS:2010}.

We require the event to have missing transverse energy
MET in excess of 25~GeV in case of muon sample and 
30 GeV in case of electron sample.
We also require W transverse mass $ > 50\,\mathrm{GeV}$.
These cuts are designed to reduce the background
from QCD multijet production.

\section{Lepton reconstruction/selection efficiencies}
\label{sec:lepeff}
Lepton reconstruction and selection efficiencies are computed using
a ``Tag \& Probe'' technique on the Drell-Yan Z$\to\ell\ell$ events in
both data and MC~\cite{tagnprobe}.  The ratios of data versus MC efficiencies for
various steps of lepton reconstruction/selection are given below. If such
a ratio is found to be statistically inconsistent with unity, it is
applied as a scale factor correction to the MC samples.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Muon reconstruction/isolation corrections}
%%%%%%%%%%%
The efficiency scale factor for muon isolation is given in
Table~\ref{tab:muonEffsRecoToIso_ScaleFactors}.  The scale factor is
statistically consistent with unity throughout.  Results consistent
with these were also obtained by the Drell-Yan group using
Z$\rightarrow\mu\mu$ events.
Figure~\ref{fig:muonisoeffsf} shows this scale factor variation in $m_{jj}$.

\section{Trigger efficiency computation}
\label{sec:trigeff}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The efficiency of the single lepton triggers are computed 
using tag \& probe technique from Z$\to\ell^+\ell^-$ events.
The procedure is straightforward and is described in detail 
in \cite{tagnprobe} and \cite{eleceff}.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Muon trigger efficiency table}
\label{sec:trigeff_mu}
The luminosity weighted average (LWA) trigger efficiency 
for single muon triggers in data is given 
in Table~\ref{tab:muonEffsIsoToHLT_data_LP_LWA}. 
The efficiency is slowly varying
with changes in lepton transverse momentum and rapidity. 
The efficiency is typically
about 90\%.

\subsection{Electron trigger efficiency table}
\label{sec:trigeff_eleEle27}
The luminosity weighted average trigger efficiency for the 
electron triggers is shown in
Table~\ref{tab:eleEffsHLTEle}.  
The value is typically about 99\% in the barrel and 92--97\% in 
the endcaps, and is weakly dependent on the electron
$p_T$ and pseudorapidity.
The efficiency for the W transverse mass leg is shown in 
Table~\ref{tab:eleEffsHLTEleMT}.  
The average value is 91.74 $\pm$ 0.07\% with a large variation depending on 
whether the electron is in the barrel or endcaps.
Fortunately for us this is just an overall scaling effect in the 
$m_{jj}$ and $m_{\ell\nu jj}$ distributions.
The impact of this turnon on the dijet invariant mass or WW invariant mass templates
(used in Higgs analysis) is negligible as shown in 
Fig~\ref{fig:singleElehlteffMT}.

\subsection{Effect of trigger efficiency on shapes}
As shown in Figs.~\ref{fig:muonhlteff}-\ref{fig:singleElehlteff}, 
the overall trigger efficiency with respect to the analysis selection criteria
is uniform~\footnote{Except for the Electron+2Jet+MHT cross-object trigger, for 
which the efficiency has significant variations in the kinematic variables of 
interest. We are currently working to take these variations into account.} 
across various trigger epochs within the systematic uncertainty. 
Since the trigger efficiency is flat, it does not alter the 
di-jet mass shape, other than introducing a 
global factor that will be absorbed in the normalization of the fit.
Therefore, we have followed the strategy not to apply any trigger 
correction in Monte Carlo. 
We compute the systematic error due to the efficiency 
uncertainty by recomputing the envelope for the MC shape templates 
and propagating these templates to the $m_{jj}$ fit as described in 
a later section.

\par
To further crosscheck the impact of the trigger correction on the
$m_{jj}$ shape, we applied a single lepton trigger requirement in the MC 
simulation (chosen by an "OR" of different single muon or single 
electron paths present in the Summer11 Monte Carlo production)
and re-derived the shapes.
The rationale is that, although the trigger implemented 
for the MC does not perfectly mimic the actual trigger, it captures
the major kinematic effects on distributions. 
However, the specific trigger paths used to select events are 
distinctly different in data and Monte Carlo. 
The online isolation and ID definitions have evolved over the 
data taking epochs and the transition is not modeled in the simulation. 
Figure~\ref{fig:triggerEffect} shows the difference in shape for 
the $m_{jj}$ distribution in the W+Jets Monte Carlo, for muons (right) 
and electrons (left) with and without applying the closest trigger paths 
available (chosen by an "OR" of different single muon or single electron 
paths). The lower frame shows the difference in shape, after correcting 
for the different area of both distributions.
The two shapes are consistent with each other within the statistical errors
of a few percent.

\subsection{Effect of trigger efficiency on yields}
The signal templates are corrected event-by-event for trigger 
efficiency. Since the efficiency is high (90--100\%) with weak  
dependence on lepton kinematics, the overall effect is small. 
The background yields remain unaffected by the absolute value 
of the trigger efficiency because the background yields are 
allowed to float in the fit.
