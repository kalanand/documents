For all measurements we present results for electron and muon 
channels separately and, assuming lepton universality 
in W and Z decays, for the combined lepton channel. The electron 
and muon channels are combined by calculating an
average value weighted by the combined statistical and systematic uncertainties, 
taking properly into account the correlated
uncertainties.
For cross section measurements, correlations are only numerically 
relevant for theoretical uncertainties, 
including the PDF uncertainties on the acceptance values. For cross 
section ratio measurements, the correlations
 of lepton efficiencies are taken into account in each lepton channel, 
with other experimental uncertainties assumed 
uncorrelated; in the combination of lepton channels, we assume fully 
correlated uncertainty for the acceptance factor, 
with other uncertainties assumed uncorrelated. The luminosity uncertainty 
cancels exactly in the cross section ratios.

We measure the following cross sections for inclusive $W$ production: 
{\footnotesize
\begin{eqnarray*}
 \WEISIGBR , \\ 
 \WMISIGBR , \\ 
 \WLISIGBR . 
\end{eqnarray*}
}
The NNLO prediction is $\THEORYSIGBRWI$.
The results for charge-specific $W$ production are
{\footnotesize
\begin{eqnarray*}
 \WEPSIGBR , \\ 
 \WMPSIGBR , \\ 
 \WLPSIGBR ; 
\end{eqnarray*}
}
and
{\footnotesize
\begin{eqnarray*}
 \WEMSIGBR , \\ 
 \WMMSIGBR , \\ 
 \WLMSIGBR . 
\end{eqnarray*}
}
The NNLO predictions for these cross sections are $\THEORYSIGBRWP$ 
for~$W^+$ and $\THEORYSIGBRWM$ for~$W^-$.  We also measure the 
following cross sections for $Z$ production:
{\footnotesize
\begin{eqnarray*}
 \ZEESIGBR , \\
 \ZMMSIGBR , \\
 \ZLLSIGBR .
\end{eqnarray*}
}
The reported $Z$ cross sections pertain to the
invariant mass range $60 < m_{\ell^+\ell^-} < 120~\GeV$, and 
are corrected for the kinematic acceptance but not for $\gamma^*$ exchange.
The NNLO prediction for $Z$ production is $\THEORYSIGBRZ$. 

\par
The ratio of cross sections for $W$ and $Z$ production is
\begin{displaymath}
  \frac{\sigma_W}{\sigma_Z} =
  \frac{N_W}{N_Z} \,
  \frac{\epsilon_Z}{\epsilon_W} \,
  \frac{A_Z}{A_W} .
\end{displaymath}
The uncertainty from $A_Z/A_W$ is determined from Monte Carlo 
generator studies to be 2\%.  The two different decay channels 
are combined by assuming fully correlated uncertainty for the 
acceptance factor, with other uncertainties assumed uncorrelated.  
This results in the measurements
\begin{eqnarray*}
  \RESRATWZE , \\
  \RESRATWZM , \\
  \RESRATWZL . \\
\end{eqnarray*}
The NNLO prediction for this ratio is $\THEORYRATIOWZ$, 
in very good agreement with our measurement.

The cross section ratios of $W^+$ and $W^-$ are given by
\begin{displaymath}
  \frac{\sigma_{W^+}}{\sigma_{W^-}} =
  \frac{N_{W^+}}{N_{W^-}} \,
  \frac{\epsilon_{W^-}}{\epsilon_{W^+}} \,
  \frac{A_{W^-}}{A_{W^+}} .
\end{displaymath}
The uncertainty from ${A_{W^-}}/{A_{W^+}}$ is determined from Monte Carlo
generator studies to be 2\%.  The two different decay channels are
combined by assuming fully correlated uncertainty for the acceptance
factor, with other uncertainties assumed uncorrelated.  This results
in the measurements:
\begin{eqnarray*}
  \RESRATWWE , \\
  \RESRATWWM , \\
  \RESRATWWL . \\
\end{eqnarray*}
The NNLO prediction is $\THEORYRATIOWW$, which agrees
with the measured values perfectly.
