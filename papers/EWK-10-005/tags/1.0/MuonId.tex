%\subsection{Muons \label{sec:muonId}}

%Muon used in this analysis are selected according to the
%quality criteria studies in
%Events with high-$\Pt$ muons are recorded online using the Level-1 muon
%trigger and the High-Level Trigger (HLT), which requires muons within $|\eta| < 2.1$ and
%with a thresholds of $\Pt>9 \GeVc$ or $\Pt>15 \GeVc$, according to the running periods. 
Muons must be identified by two different algorithms~\cite{MUONPAS}: one proceeds from 
the inner tracker outwards (``tracker muons''), the other one starts from 
segments in the muon chambers and proceeds inwards (``global muons''). 
Decays in flight of hadrons and punch-through are reducing a cut of $\chi^2/ndof < 10$ 
on a global fit containing tracker and muon detector hits. 
In order to ensure a precise estimate of momentum and impact parameter 
%(the muon momentum resolution is dominated by the inner tracker detector
%for the tranverse momentum range interesting for this measurement)
only tracks with more than 10 hits and at least one hit in the pixel detector are used. 
We require at least two levels of muon stations in the measurement, 
to ensures a good quality momentum estimate at trigger level, and
to further suppresses remaining fake muon candidates.
%For the $\Zmm$ analysis we minimize the cross-corrlation between tracker and muon 
%detectors by drop the $\chi^2/{\mathrm{ndof}}$ and 
%the request that the muon is found by the tracker algorithm.
Cosmics are rejected by requiring a transverse impact parameter distance to the beam spot
position of less than 2 mm.
