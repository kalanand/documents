%\subsection{Muon Efficiencies \label{sec:muonEff}}

The muon reconstruction overall selection efficiency 
is determined by the efficiency to find a track in the inner tracker and in the
muon chambers, to pass the isolation requirements, and the probability 
to pass the L1 trigger and HLT.

Tag-and-Probe method is used to determine muon efficiencies for $\Wmn$ cross section determination,
while for $\Zmm$ muon efficiencies are determined simultaneously with the Z yield using a simultaneous
fit technique that is described in Section~\ref{sec:Zmumu}. 
%Tag-and-Probe method uses a clean sample of $\Zmm$ candidates selected from the 36~pb$^{-1}$ available data
%on which about 22000 triggered muon {\em tags} are selected.
%$\Zmm$ events have muon kinematics very similar to those used in the $\Wo$ analysis.
%The possible presence of background processes in the selected event sample has been also taken into account.

%, making use of the 2 million events
%The efficiency ratio 
%$\rho_\mu = {\epsilon_{\mathrm{data}}}/{\epsilon_{\mathrm{MC}}}$ 
%has been calculated in order to be applied to the  
%W cross-section determination. 
The efficiencies have been studied as a function of muon pseudorapidity and transverse momentum, 
to reproduce better the real detector performance. 
The promediated efficiencies are estimated to be
$\epsilon_{\mathrm{data}} = 0.8548 \pm 0.0025\, \mathrm{(stat)} \pm  0.024\, \mathrm{(syst)}$ and
$\epsilon_{\mathrm{MC}} = 0.8989  \pm   0.0004\, \mathrm{(stat)}$ in data and Monte Carlo respectively,
hence a correction factor of $\rho_\mu= 0.9509 \pm  0.0028 \mathrm{(stat)} \pm  0.024\, \mathrm{(syst)}$
has been appled to the data.
The quoted systematic errors take into account the fit parameter uncertainties stemming 
from the correction of the background.

Single-muon efficiencies have also been determined separating in positive or negative charged muons, 
obtaining the following correction factors: $\rho_\mu^+ = 0.957 \pm 0.004\,\mathrm{(stat)} \pm 0.024\,\mathrm{(syst)}$,
$\rho_\mu^- = 0.945 \pm 0.004\,\mathrm{(stat)} \pm 0.024\,\mathrm{(syst)}$.

A small fraction (0.5\%) of muon events is lost because of Level-1 trigger pre-firing
due to the wrong assignment to the muon bunch crossing number, due to imperfect timing. 
Cross sections in muon channels have been corrected by this effect and
the uncertainty on the correction factor has been taken as systematic uncertainty.
