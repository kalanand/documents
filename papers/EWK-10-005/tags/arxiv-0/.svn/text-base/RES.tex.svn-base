\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

The results for the electron and muon channels are presented separately.
Assuming lepton universality, we combine our measurements in the different lepton
decay modes. The electron and muon channels are combined by calculating an
average value weighted by the combined statistical and systematic uncertainties,
taking into account the correlated uncertainties.
For the cross-section measurements, correlations are only numerically
relevant for theoretical uncertainties,
including the PDF uncertainties on the acceptance values. For the cross
section ratio measurements, the correlations
of lepton efficiencies are taken into account in each lepton channel.
%with other experimental uncertainties assumed
%uncorrelated;
In the combination of lepton channels, fully
correlated theoretical uncertainties are assumed for the acceptance factor,
with other uncertainties assumed uncorrelated. The luminosity uncertainty
cancels exactly in the cross-section ratios.

The NNLO predictions of the total cross sections and their ratios were estimated
using {\sc fewz} and the MSTW 2008 PDF. The uncertainties, at 68$\%$ CL, include
contributions from the strong coupling $\alpha_S$~\cite{Martin:2009bu,GWatt}, the choice of heavy quark masses
(charm and bottom quarks)~\cite{Martin:2009hq} as well as neglected higher-order corrections
beyond NNLO, by allowing the renormalization and factorization scales to vary in a similar way to that
described in Section~\ref{sec:theory}.

The following cross sections for inclusive $\Wo$ production are measured:
{\footnotesize
\begin{eqnarray*}
 \WEISIGBR , \\
 \WMISIGBR , \\
 \WLISIGBR .
\end{eqnarray*}
}%
The corresponding NNLO prediction is $\THEORYSIGBRWI$.
The results for charge-specific $\Wo$ production are
{\footnotesize
\begin{eqnarray*}
 \WEPSIGBR , \\
 \WMPSIGBR , \\
 \WLPSIGBR ,
\end{eqnarray*}
}%
and
{\footnotesize
\begin{eqnarray*}
 \WEMSIGBR , \\
 \WMMSIGBR , \\
 \WLMSIGBR .
\end{eqnarray*}
}%
The NNLO predictions for these cross sections are $\THEORYSIGBRWP$
for~$\Wp$ and $\THEORYSIGBRWM$ for~$\Wm$.
The following cross sections for inclusive $\Zo$ production are measured:
{\footnotesize
\begin{eqnarray*}
 \ZEESIGBR , \\
 \ZMMSIGBR , \\
 \ZLLSIGBR .
\end{eqnarray*}
}%
The reported $\Zo$ cross sections correspond to the
invariant mass range $60 < m_{\ell^+\ell^-} < 120~\GeV$, and
are corrected for the kinematic acceptance but not for $\gamma^*$ exchange.
The NNLO prediction for $\Zo$ production is $\THEORYSIGBRZ$.

\par
The ratio of cross sections for $\Wo$ and $\Zo$ production is
\begin{displaymath}
  \frac{\sigma_{\Wo}}{\sigma_{\Zo}} =
  \frac{N_{\Wo}}{N_{\Zo}} \,
  \frac{\epsilon_{\Zo}}{\epsilon_{\Wo}} \,
  \frac{A_{\Zo}}{A_{\Wo}} \,,
\end{displaymath}
where $A_{\Zo}$ and $A_{\Wo}$ are the acceptances for Z and W selections, respectively.
The two different decay channels
are combined by assuming fully correlated uncertainties for the
acceptance factors, with other uncertainties assumed uncorrelated.
The resulting ratios are:
\begin{eqnarray*}
  \RESRATWZE , \\
  \RESRATWZM , \\
  \RESRATWZL . \\
\end{eqnarray*}
The NNLO prediction for this ratio is $\THEORYRATIOWZ$,
in good agreement with the measured value.

The ratio of cross sections for $\Wp$ and $\Wm$ production is given by
\begin{displaymath}
  \frac{\sigma_{\Wp}}{\sigma_{\Wm}} =
  \frac{N_{\Wp}}{N_{\Wm}} \,
  \frac{\epsilon_{\Wm}}{\epsilon_{\Wp}} \,
  \frac{A_{\Wm}}{A_{\Wp}} \,,
\end{displaymath}
where $A_{\Wp}$ and $A_{\Wm}$ are the acceptances for $\Wp$ and $\Wm$, respectively.
The two different decay channels are combined by assuming fully correlated uncertainties for the acceptance
factors, with other uncertainties assumed uncorrelated.  This results
in the measurements:
\begin{eqnarray*}
  \RESRATWWE , \\
  \RESRATWWM , \\
  \RESRATWWL . \\
\end{eqnarray*}
The NNLO prediction for this ratio is $\THEORYRATIOWW$, which agrees
with the presented measurement.

Summaries of the measurements are given in Figs.~\ref{fig:WZ_LEPstylePlots},
 \ref{fig:WPM_LEPstylePlots}, and~\ref{fig:R_LEPstylePlots},
illustrating the consistency of the measurements
in the electron and muon channels, as well as confirming the
theoretical predictions computed at the NNLO in QCD with state-of-the-art
PDF sets. For each reported measurement, the statistical error is represented in black and
the total experimental uncertainty, obtained by adding in quadrature the statistical and
systematic uncertainties, in dark blue. For the cross-section measurements, the luminosity
uncertainty is added to the experimental uncertainty, and is represented in green.
The dark-yellow vertical line represents the theoretical prediction, and the light-yellow
vertical band is the theoretical uncertainty, interpreted as a 68$\%$ confidence interval,
as described earlier.

The ratios of the measurements to the theoretical
predictions are listed in Table~\ref{tab:RatioCMSTHY}
and displayed in Fig.~\ref{fig:RatioCMSTHY}. The experimental
uncertainty (``exp.'') is computed as the sum in quadrature of the
statistical uncertainty and the systematic uncertainties aside
from the luminosity uncertainty and the
theoretical uncertainties associated with the acceptance.
The theoretical uncertainty (``th.'') is computed by adding in
quadrature the theoretical uncertainties of the acceptance (or the
acceptance ratio) and the NNLO prediction, assuming that they are
uncorrelated.

Figure~\ref{fig:WZsigmas} shows the CMS W and Z cross section measurements together
with measurements at lower center-of-mass energy hadron colliders.
The predicted increase of the cross sections with center of mass energy is confirmed
by our measurements.

Table~\ref{tab:res-restricted-xsections} reports the cross sections as
measured within the fiducial and kinematic acceptance, thereby eliminating the PDF uncertainties
from the results. In effect, these
uncertainties are transferred to the theoretical predictions,
allowing for a cleaner separation of experimental and
theoretical uncertainties.
For each channel the fiducial and kinematic acceptance
is defined as the fraction of events with lepton $\pt$ greater than $25~\GeV$
($20~\GeV$ for $\Zmm$), including no final-state QED radiation,
and with pseudorapidity in the range $|\eta|<2.5$ for electrons
and $|\eta|<2.1$ for muons.
