\section{Efficiencies}
\label{sec:efficiencies}

A key component of this analysis is the estimation of lepton efficiencies.
The efficiency is determined for different selection steps:
\begin{itemize}
\item offline reconstruction of the lepton;
\item lepton selection, with identification and isolation criteria;
\item trigger (L1+HLT).
\end{itemize}
The order of the above selections steps is important. Lepton efficiency for each
selection is determined with respect to the prior step.

A tag-and-probe (\TNP) technique is used, as described below, on pure samples of $\Zll$ events.
The statistical uncertainty on the efficiencies is
ultimately propagated as a systematic uncertainty on the cross-section measurements.
This procedure has the advantage
of extracting the efficiencies from a sample of leptons kinematically very similar
to those used in the $\Wo$ analysis and exploits the relatively pure selection
of $\Zll$ events obtained after a dilepton invariant mass requirement around the Z mass.
\par
The \TNP method is as follows: one lepton candidate,
called the ``tag'', satisfies trigger criteria, tight identification
and isolation requirements. The other lepton candidate, called the ``probe'',
is required to pass specific criteria that depend on the efficiency under study.
\par
For each kind of efficiency, the \TNP method is applied to real data and to
simulated samples, and the ratio of efficiencies in data ($\effdata$) and simulation ($\effmc$) is computed:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:rho}
 \rhoeff = \frac{\effdata}{\effmc}\,,
\end{equation}
together with the associated statistical and systematic uncertainties.
