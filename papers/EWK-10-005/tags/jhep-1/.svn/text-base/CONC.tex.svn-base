\section{Summary}
\label{sec:conclusions}

Measurements of the inclusive $\Wo$ and $\Zo$ production cross sections have been performed 
using a data sample of pp collision events at $\sqrt{s}=7\TeV$ 
collected with the CMS detector at the LHC in 2010 and 
corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36~pb$^{-1}$. 
The inclusive production cross sections of $\Wp$ and $\Wm$ have been measured separately 
as well as the ratios of the $\Wp/\Wm$ and $\Wo/\Zo$ production cross sections.  
All measurements are dominated by systematic uncertainties,  
the main uncertainty originating from the integrated luminosity (4\%), which cancels in the ratios.
Experimental systematic uncertainties range from
0.7 to 1.8\%, and theoretical uncertainties range from 0.9 to 2.1\%.
The measurement of the $\Wo/\Zo$ cross-section ratio also leads to an
indirect determination of $\Gamma(\Wo)$, which is in agreement with the
current world average. 
%and with the SM prediction.

The results agree with the ATLAS measurement~\cite{WZATLAS:2010} 
and with previous CMS results~\cite{WZCMS:2010}.
All measurements are consistent with the SM NNLO predictions.



%Figure~\ref{fig:WZsigmas} shows the CMS W and Z cross section measurements together 
%with measurements at lower center-of-mass energy hadron colliders.
%The predicted increase of the cross sections with center of mass energy is confirmed
%by our measurements.
