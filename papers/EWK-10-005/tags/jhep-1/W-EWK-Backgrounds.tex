\subsection{Electroweak Backgrounds}
\label{sec:EWKbkgds}

A certain fraction of the events passing the selection criteria for $\Wln$
are due to other EWK processes. Several sources of
contamination have been identified. The events with $\Zll$ 
(DY background), where one of the two leptons lies
beyond the detector acceptance and escapes
detection, mimic the signature of $\Wln$ events. Events from $\Ztt$ and $\Wtn$,
with the tau decaying leptonically, have in general a lower-momentum lepton than signal
events and are strongly suppressed by the minimum $\Pt$ requirements.

The $\MET$ shape for the EWK vector boson and ${\mathrm t}\bar{\mathrm t}$ contributions are
evaluated from simulations. For the main EWK backgrounds ($\Zll$ and $\Wtn $), the $\MET$ shape is 
corrected by means of the procedure described in Section~\ref{sec:WsignalMETtemplate}.
The $\MET$ shapes are evaluated separately for $\Wptn$ and $\Wmtn$.

A summary of the EWK and $\ttbar$ background fractions in the $\Wen$ and $\Wmn$ analyses can be found in Table~\ref{tab:WlnBG}.
The fractions are similar for the $\Wen$ and $\Wmn$ channels, 
except for the DY background which is higher in the $\Wen$ channel. 
The difference is mainly due to the tighter definition of the DY veto in the $\Wmn$ channel, 
which is not compensated by the larger geometrical acceptance of electrons 
($|\eta|<2.5$) with respect to muons ($|\eta|<2.1$).
% with respect to $\Wen$ channel (the electron analysis rejects an event 
%if there is a second electron with $\Et>20.0\GeV$ while the muon analysis 
%rejects an event if there is a second muon with $\Pt>10\GeV$).
