The efficiencies for lepton reconstruction, identification,
isolation and trigger efficiencies are obtained from clean $\Zll$ 
data samples where one lepton is selected with tight  
requirements and the required selection is probed on the other
lepton (\TNP method). The invariant mass of the \TNP lepton candidates
must fall in the range $60$--$120~\GeV$.
Correction factors are the ratios of efficiencies extracted from data and simulations 
($\rho = {\epsilon_{\mathrm{data}}}/{\epsilon_{\mathrm{MC}}}$) 
applying the same tag-and-probe algorithm.
