\subsubsection{$\Zee$}


The event selection requirements for $\Zee$ are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
two electrons within acceptance (as defined above, in Section~\ref{sec:electronId}),
satisfying the WP80 selection,
\item
the dielectron mass must satisfy $60 < m_{\mathrm{ee}} < 120$~GeV.
\end{enumerate}
\par
There is no requirement on the charges of the electrons.
These requirements select \ZEESAMPLE events.
