\subsubsection{$\Wen$}

The event selection requirements for $\Wen$ are then as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
one identified electron within acceptance, satisfying the WP80 set
of identification and isolation criteria,
\item
if a second electron candidate with $\Et > 20~\gev$, within ECAL fiducial 
and satisfying looser identification and isolation criteria (WP95) is present
in the event, the event is rejected.
\end{enumerate}

The number of $\Wen$ candidate events selected
in the data sample is
$\WEISAMPLE$, with
$\WEPSAMPLE$ positrons and
$\WEMSAMPLE$ electrons.
