\subsection{Missing Transverse Energy}
\label{sec:MET}
An accurate $\MET$ measurement is essential for distinguishing
$\Wo$ signal from QCD backgrounds. We use $\MET$ estimate provided
by the Particle Flow (PF) algorithm which showed the best performance for the
CMS detector. Details on Particle Flow $\MET$ are provided in Ref.~\cite{PFMET}. 
\par
Very good agreement of the $\MET$
distributions in $\Wln$ in data and simulation was found~\cite{metPAS}.
\par
The $\MET$ is computed as the vector sum of all PF objects.
The resolution for inclusive multi-jet samples and for
$\Wln$ events is well reproduced by the 
simulation.  A modest broadening of about $10\%$ is observed 
when there is more than one primary vertex; this occurs in less 
than $40\%$ of the events and has a negligible impact on the
extraction of the $W$ yields described below.
