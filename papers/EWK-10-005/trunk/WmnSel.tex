\subsubsection{$\Wmn$ Event Selection}
\label{sec:WmnSel}

% $\Wmn$ events are characterized by a high-$\Pt$, isolated muon,
% together with a significant amount of missing $\Et$, due to the
% presence of a neutrino in the final-state, that escapes undetected.

The first step in the $\Wmn$ candidate selection is to
reject those events having two global muons satisfying: $\Pt(\mu_1) >
20~\GeV$ and $\Pt(\mu_2) > 10~\GeV$, where $\Pt(\mu_1)$ is the
highest muon $\Pt$ and $ \Pt(\mu_2)$ is the second highest muon $\Pt$
in the event, in order to minimize the contamination from DY
events.

Events with a good quality muon, as described in Section~\ref{sec:muonid},
in the fiducial volume $|\eta|<2.1$, and with a transverse momentum
higher than $25~\GeV$ are kept.
Relative combined isolation variable (see Section~\ref{sec:isolation}) is used to evaluate the level of activity around the
muon. Isolation distribution of the experimental data, together with the simulation expectations, is shown in
Fig.~\ref{figure:Wmunu_iso}. The muon is considered to be isolated if $\IRelComb < 0.1$.
Events with $\IRelComb > 0.2$ are mainly coming from QCD background, and are be used as 
control sample (see Section~\ref{sec:WQCDbkg}).

Dots represent the data and the solid histograms the contribution from the different SM processes.
The superimposed arrows represent the signal selection requirement (red
arrow, $\IRelComb<0.1$) and selection of the QCD-enriched
control sample (green arrow, $\IRelComb>0.2$).

97533 of them with a positive charged muon and 68924 with a negative
charged muon.
