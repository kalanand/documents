Dear Antonio, 

Thank you very much for the useful suggestions and the numerous corrections you sent us. 

We implemented the vast majority of, if not all, the editorial comments that we received. 
In some cases, comments from different reviewers overlap or suggest incompatible changes. 
In many of those and other cases the best solution was to rephrase the sentence or 
paragraph involved. The number of editorial comments, due to the size of the paper, is too 
large to give a reply for every single comment. 

Here we collect some questions that we think are necessary to address:

Q: 
The paper is mostly written in first person as from the first sentence in the Abstract 
(We present ...). The CMS Collaboration is too important as to allow such a way of writing. 
The paper should therefore be entirely rewritten. I include here some examples of lines that 
need to be changed because of the use of the first person: [...] 
A: 
Done in the abstract and in most of the Sections of the paper. A few first person sentences 
are left, according to the PubBoard guidelines. On average one every 5 pages now. 

Q: 
In Lines 70 to 79. The ECAL rough energy resolution is mentioned, but as in most of the CMS 
papers nothing is said about the HCAL energy resolution. Here, not even a rough estimate is 
given. However, for the analysis presented here, the HCAL energy reconstruction is used. 
Please, think about saying a minimum on this subject. 
A: 
We added a sentence on HCAL similar to CERN-PH-EP/2011-044. 

Q: 
Lines 168 and 169. Please complete the text by defining the variables later used: H/E and sihih 
A: 
The sihih variable was mentioned twice. This is now corrected. The sihih is a measure of the 
e/m shower width in eta direction. The H/E is defined on line 168.
 
Q: 
In the Captions of Figs. 1 and 2 it is said that the simulated signal (histograms) are 
normalized to the same number of events as in the data (dots). I was expected equal areas 
for both types of events in all figures. I have the impression that this is not the case, 
but may be is just an effect of the logarithmic scale and that the dots are too thick. 
A: 
The intension was to normalize as described above. We double checked w/o finding any 
normalization problem. 

Q: 
Lines 210-211. I suggest discarding the sentence: .Moreover (?), the global muon 
fit .... less than 10... I think is better to say nothing than admit you are happy with 
any chi^2/NDF ratio. 
A: 
The cut is actually not applied to ensure the quality of the fit, but to reject fake muons. 
The text has been improved adding: "in order to reject fake muons and mis-reconstructed 
particles".

Q: 
Lines 467-468 and Table 7. You have to use a unique definition (the correct one, of course!). 
Background fraction means B/(B+S) and ratio of background to signal is B/S. Use the correct 
expression in text and Table. 
A: 
Both text and table caption unambiguously refer to background-to-signal ratio that is B/S. 

Q:
Caption of Fig. 27. To avoid confusion I would finish the last sentence by .... the total 
experimental, theoretical and luminosity uncertainties. The luminosity uncertainties 
amount to 3.4% for ATLAS and 4% for CMS...
A:
Removed comparison to ATLAS from Fig. according to CMS rule not to cite conf. notes. 


Thank you once more for your time and effort to read and improve this paper.

All the best, 
Georgios & Luca
