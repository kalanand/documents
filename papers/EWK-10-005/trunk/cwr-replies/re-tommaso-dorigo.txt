Dear Tommaso,

thanks for your comments, they helped improve the quality of the paper. 

For what concerns rest of editorial comments, we implemented the vast majority of, 
if not all, the editorial comments that we received. In some cases, comments from 
different reviewers overlap or suggest incompatible changes. In many of those and 
other cases we found as the best solution to rephrase the sentence or paragraph 
involved. The number of editorial comments, due to the size of the paper, 
is too large to give a reply for every single comment. 
The latest posted draft contains most of the editorial changes.

Below the replies to the non-editorial and main editorial comments.

Q:
L189 (discussing Fig.1 and 2): I think the agreement in these figures between data 
and simulation is quite poor (especially in endcaps), and this would require 
a comment in the text, but I see nothing. Please explain why there is very bad 
matching in some of the variables, even in the isolated electron region. 
Examples are delta-eta and delta-phi in the endcaps, and H/E.
A:
As we explain in the captions, the data are signal+background while the MC is pure 
signal normalized to the number of data (S+B). We don't expect an agreement of 
the data & MC signal distributions. We just show how the signal looks like and 
how the background affects the distributions. 

Q:
L743 What is a "Poissonian likelihood" ? I suggest that you write the expression in full.
A:
Likelihood is just the one reported in Baker & Cousins paper that we cite and the recommended 
standard by PDG. No modification has been done for our case, se we prefer to leave just 
the reference.

Q:
L746 awkward sentence: "measure"->"measures". However we suggest that you add detail of how 
this p-value is defined. As it is, the sentence is quite un-informative. How do we 
extract the goodness-of-fit measure ?
A:
Rephrased as: "A goodness-of-fit test gives a probability (p-value) of 0.36 for this fit". 
It's the chi^2 probability from likelihood ratio using the Wilks' theorem approximation, 
as from the Baker & Cousins paper we refer to (see above point).

Q:
L185 "eliminates" is quite a strong word - we cannot be sure 100% that we have absolutely 
no QCD events left. I suggest we soften this sentence a bit, such as in "reduces to a 
negligible level" or "strongly reduces".
A:
Rephrased: "reduces the QCD backgrounds to a negligible level" 

Q:
L493-494 What are the prob(chi2) and prob(KS) ? They are addressed together as 
"Kolmogorov-Smirnov probabilities" but the first looks like something else. 
Are they just labeled incorrectly ?
A:
this was actually a mistake due to copy and paste, we use only KS probabilities. 
We rephrased the entire sentence mentioning KS probabilities only.

Best regards,
Georgios and Luca
