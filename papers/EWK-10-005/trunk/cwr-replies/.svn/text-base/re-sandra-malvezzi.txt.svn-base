Dear Sandra, 

Thank you very much for the useful suggestions and the numerous corrections you sent us.

We implemented the vast majority of, if not all, the editorial comments that we received.
In some cases, comments from different reviewers overlap or suggest incompatible changes.
In many of those and other cases the best solution was to rephrase the sentence or
paragraph involved. The number of editorial comments, due to the size of the paper, is too
large to give a reply for every single comment.

Here we collect some questions that we think are necessary to address:

Q: 
Line 193-196 In the event selection for Z->ee is "an opposite charge" (as for Z->mumu) 
required ? 
A: 
It is stated on line 195. This sentence is anticipated to line 162. 

Q: 
Line 300 the T&P eff in MC is based on signal-only sample. Has it been verified in 
MC that adding the (very small) background does not change the efficiency ? 
If so it could be explicitaly said. 
A: 
The T&P is used for the estimation of efficiency correction factors. The correction factor is 
defined as TnP_data/TnP_MC. Data distributions are contaminated by background which is subtracted 
and the corresponding systematic uncertainties are estimated. The procedure is checked with MC but 
in the determination of correction factors we didn't use any bkgd contamination in the signal sample 
at MC level which should be later on subtracted. So the background subtraction is only relevant for 
data and not MC. We didn't modify the text. 

Q:
Line 304: it is mentioned that the efficiency has been measured for e+ and e-. The number(s) is(are) 
not reported and it is not said whether they were found to be different (or not) This is also 
the case at line 325 
A:
The important numbers for the analysis are the corrected efficiencies. These are quoted in table 3 
for W+, W-, W. The correction factors can be extracted from the same table. We didn't add the e+ 
and e- efficiencies because we didn't want to fill the paper with too many tables. 

Q:
Line 513 -> are those correction derived from MC? 
A:
No, the corrections are entirely data driven: the correction referred to in lines 516-518 is applied 
by constructing the data derived QCD templates (from inversion of the deltaEta cut) separately for 
events with pfMVA greater than and less than the value -0.1 used to identify electrons in particle 
flow. The two templates are summed according to their relative populations in the selected sample, 
also in data. The second correction, for signal contamination is also data driven, as described in 
lines 520-522. 

Q:
Line 522 If the information is available, add a number to give an idea of the signal contamination 
in the background sample. 
A:
The fraction of the QCD template that is composed of signal events is determined from data using 
tag and probe to be 1.17%. 

Q:
The ABCDE method: the "E" region is in the figure and in the name but it is never defined and it 
is not used. 
A:
It is true that events in the E region are not used in the analysis. But they do come into the 
optimization that decides the boundary to be placed as the maximum isolation (ie where the E region 
begins) in order to reduce the systematic error coming from the uncertainty of eP (isolation efficiency) 
and the bias introduced from pathalogical fake events which are poorly isolated in the assumption 
that f_A = f_D. We agree it is confusing to have it as a region since those events aren't used so we 
modified the text by removing any reference to E region. 

Q:
Line 543 Is the assumption that the two parameters are equal based on the fact that the isolation 
requirement does not affect the MET spectrum for event for fake electrons ? If so it may be worth 
adding something like "By assuming that the MET spectrum in event with fake electrons is not affected 
by the isolation these two parameters are equal and all direct ..." 
A:
Yes this is the assumption. We write : "If the efficiency for passing the $\MET$ boundary is largely 
independent of the choice of the boundaries on $\ITRK/E_T$ then these two parameters will be approximately 
equal. Assuming $f_A=f_D$ holds exactly leads to a simplification of the system of equations such that 
all direct dependence of the signal extraction on parameters relating to the QCD backgrounds is eliminated. 
For this idealised case there would be no uncertainty on the extracted signal yield arising from modelling 
of QCD backgrounds. Detailed studies of the data suggest this assumption holds to a good degree." 

Q:
Line 553-554 we do not see how epsilon_a and epsilon_d (efficiency in passing the MET cut) are measured 
with T&P. 
A:
What we wrote is not correct. They are measured using the data-driven signal model which is also used in the other 
techniques, derived in the A+B (well isolated) and C+D (less isolated) regions separately. It is now corrected 
in the text. 

Q:
Line 701, 702 703 from the equation listed on page 30 we think that the isolated global muon should also 
be required here to match and HLT muon, is it correct ? 
A:
Correct. We clarified in the text: "In all other categories global muons must correspond to an HLT 
trigger muon" 

Q:
Line 703, from the equation on page 30 the "at least one non isolated" seem "exactly one non isolated" 
A:
Right. We corrected the text: "A pair of global muons, of which one is isolated and the other is non-isolated." 

Q:
Line 624 Nbkg = 4.9+/-8.4+/-8.4 It is not clear if the Nbckg estimate is inferred from a simultaneous fit or 
it is used as a number to be subtracted from the Z yield. In the last case we think we should not have an 
uncertainty leading to a negative contribution. 
A:
It is a number that must be subtracted from the Z yield. Concerning the issue of negative contributions
we believe the effect will be small but we 'll check it. In any case the background is quite small so even 
if we quote a larger uncertainty will not affect the final result.

Q:
Line 629 as Line 624. Also in table 8, in particular when propagating the uncertainties on the total background 
A:
This estimation is just a cross check. It is not used in the measurement. We will follow the same recipe 
as in the previous question.

Q:
Line 626 measured charged mis-identification. How is this measurement performed ? If it measured with SS/OS in 
Zee it can not be used ... 
A:
The idea is that we measure the charge mis-id in a "clean" Zee sample (by applying additional cuts) and then we 
use it in a sample with looser cuts in which we estimate the signal and background. Details in CMS AN-2010/277. 

Q:
table 11, it is not clear why the uncertainties on the trigger pre-firing are the same in W and Z, since this 
effect is 0.5% for W and 1% for Z. 
A:
pre-triggering only affects the barrel, and the uncertainty is on the overall acceptance. Moreover, it's a 
derived quantity and the 0.5% is considered a conservative upper limit that applies to both cases. 

Q:
Line 939, in fact from table 12 and 13 it seems that also the uncertainty in the background subtraction 
method/modeling have been (correctly) treated as correlated. 
A:
Correct: removed wrong statement 

Q:
Line 178 the "loose" requirements on electrons in then never used in the analysis 
A:
It is used in the Z veto which is one of the Wenu selection requirements. See line 190. 

Q:
Line 435 Is the recoil in data measured with PF ? 
A:
Yes. Specified in the text: "The recoil to the vector boson is defined as the negative of the 
vector $\sum\Et$ of all particles reconstructed with the PF algorithm" 

Q:
Sec: 7.2 MC efficiency for muon in table 6. Since the efficiency depends on eta and the lepton 
from W+ and W- have slightly different eta distribution we would expect that the overall efficiency 
is different for W+ and W-. 
A:
Two different quantities are evaluated by MC: 
a) Acceptance x efficiency term, A_W= Number of selected events/Number of generated events. 
Values for A_W term are not given explicitly in the paper. 
b) Acceptance term, A_kin=Number of events with a generated muon within defined 
acceptance (pt>25 GeV, eta<2.1)/ Number of generated events. 
Values for A_kin are given in table 1. 
c)MC efficiencies quoted in Table 6 are derived quantities determined as eff = A_W/A_kin. 
Figures quoted there have been exhaustively checked, the fact that they end up being so close 
numerically is just accidental. It essentially means that eff. for W+ and W- are equal for events 
within acceptance.

Q:
Sec 10: In the systematics on W+/W- ratios it is not completely cleat how the uncertainty on 
the efficiency is calculated. Two efficiency are calculated with T&P separately for l+ and l-. 
The statistical errors on the two are independent so they can be propagated to the ratio. 
This is less evident for systematics. Question: the eff for l+ and l- are very close in MC 
and compatible within the error in data. Why a common values can not be used for W+ and W-, 
in this case most of the error should cancel in the ratio (still a small uncertainties may 
remains from the different distribution in eta) 
A:
The choice for electrons was to use "+" and "-" efficiencies estimated separately. In this way 
any systematic from the assumption of equal efficiencies of "+" and "-" is avoided. 

Q:
Figure 27. When comparing in the plot the ATLAS and CMS results it is said that the uncertainties 
includes experimental, theoretical and luminosity uncertainties, but the theoretical uncertainties 
(e.g. acceptances ) should be highly correlated. 
A:
Removed comparison to ATLAS from Fig. according to CMS rule not to cite conf. notes. 

Q:
As a final general remark: it is not always clear why electron and muon analyses are performed with 
different techniques (e.g three electron methods but only one muon method for W) 
A:
Electron analyses in general are a bit more difficult than muons mainly due to the higher backgrounds. 
So the cross checks are more important for electrons than for muons. The fact that in some cases 
electrons & muons have chosen different techniques is also a matter of taste. The important thing 
here is to have complete & robust results rather than being completely synchronized. 
We added few sentences in the paper to mention it.

Thank you once more for your time and effort to read and improve this paper.

All the best,
Georgios & Luca
