Dear Greg,

Thank you very much for the useful suggestion and the numerous corrections you sent us. 

For what concerns rest of editorial comments, we implemented the vast majority of, if not 
all, the editorial comments that we received. In some cases, comments from different 
reviewers overlap or suggest incompatible changes. In many of those and other cases we 
found as the best solution to rephrase the sentence or paragraph involved. The number 
of editorial comments, due to the size of the paper, is too large to give a reply for 
every single comment. The latest posted draft contains almost all of the editorial changes.

Below the replies to the non-editorial and main editorial comments.

Q:
1) L15: should use m_{W/Z}^2 here (as done on L21), as you are talking 
about both the W and Z. Also, you shouldn't call this value a Q^2 (which it is not); 
this is really \hat s! Ditto on L21: \hat s = ...
A:
Done 

Q:
2) L27: add references to the HERA and Tevatron data.
A:
Added 

Q:
3) LL162,182,185 and below: do you explicitly require the two electrons to have opposite charges? 
If so, state this on or around L162; if not, you should also state this and not use but rather . 
Which one is it?
A:
It is stated on line 195 (no charge requirement). This sentence has been anticipated to line 162 for 
better readability.

Q:
4) Figs 1-2: suggest adding the legend to all the panes. Also, figures must say "CMS" and "36 \ipb 
at sqrt{s} = 7 TeV" on them.
A:    
We have grouped the selection variables in electron-ID and Isolation. We don't see the benefit of repeating 
the same legend many times. The figures are updated and contain the "CMS" and the usual energy and luminosity 
information. 

Q:
5) Fig. 3: the legend for data should show a vertical error bar, not just a dot.
A:
Added. The legend has been removed since data is the only entry in the plot, according to another 
opposite comment. According to the publication board, it is acceptable to use a dot w/o a 
vertical error bar.

Q:
6) L296: add a reference to the Crystal Ball function.
A:
Added 

Q:
7) L328: define the "2-bin case" - what are the two bins?
A:
Added: "...2-bin case in which the efficiencies were estimated in two bins of $\eta$ (EB and EE)." 

Q:
9) Figs. 6 and 7: legend should show a red dot with an error bar (left); add a legend on the right.
A:
Errors added; right legend not added because of an opposite comment requesting to delete if there 
is only one entry,  as for comment 5) .We will check the proper solution with the publication board.
 
Q:
10) LL412-414: the logic is flawed here as you are discussing the QCD background and then suddenly 
tell that at high MET it's insignificant and that the more important background is EWK. 
Suggest: The QCD multijet ... in W analyses. At high \MET, EWK backgrounds ... Yan, also become relevant ...
A:
Rephrased: "The QCD multijet background is one of the most significant backgrounds in W analyses. 
At high $\MET$, EWK backgrounds, in particular $\Wtn$ and Drell--Yan, also become relevant, leading 
to contaminations levels of the order of $\sim 10\%$ or so." 

Q:
11) LL435-446: is the difference between the W and Z mass, which generally could affect the recoil 
spectrum taken into account? If s, how big is the effect?
A:
It's taken into account, as written in the text. We have now rephrased as: "The ratios of data to 
simulation fit parameters from Z samples are used as scale factors to correct the W simulated recoil 
curves. The recoil in simulated W events is replaced with the values drawn from the corrected W recoil 
distributions adding the energy of the W leptons back to recalculate the E/T value for each event."

Q:
12) L494: you talked about the KS probabilities, but quote the chi^2 probability for the W+ sample - 
I hope you meant the KS one. Since it's clear that you talk about probabilities, just say are for the sample and for the ...
A:
Yes, it was a copy and paste problem. Fixed in the text.

Q:
13) Fig. 10-12, 14: Data markers in the legend should show a vertical error bar. 
Explain the bottom pane and the \chi on the y-axis.
A:
The bottom pane is explained earlier. See lines 450-452. 

Q:
14) Fig. 13: add CMS, 35 \ipb at \sqrt{s} = 7 TeV; change a.u. to Arbitrary Units.
A:
This plot is made using simulation so the 35/pb make no sense here. 
Not sure if we want to keep the sqrt(s)=7 TeV. a.u. replaced.

Q:
15) Fig. 15: remove X_cut and Y_cut labels.
A:
The plot is updated with a brand new one, entirely restyled. 

Q:
16) LL542-544: The sentence "By assuming ... is eliminating" is completely unintelligible. 
Please, rephrase for clarity, as it's impossible to understand what you meant to say here.
A:
The whole paragraph has been re-written. 

Q:
18) Fig. 17: please use the same dashed histogram for the non-isolated background 
as in Fig. 16 (left) - two series of dots are too confusing. In the legend change second 
and third entries to: "QCD non-isolated, corrected" and "QCD non-isolated".
A:
Histograms restyled; caption mentioning "data" left for better readability, and remark 
the difference w.r.t. the previous figure

Q:
21) Table 8 caption: the last clause is technically not correct as for the 
loose Z \to \mu\mu you are still using fit to data.
A:
Added for completeness: "(for $\Zmm$: only for candidates in the ``golden'' category)" 

Q:
22) In the rows 5-6 of the table, did you explicitly exclude the 1.44-1.57 region in |eta| when 
producing the entries?
A:
Since the backgrounds are passing the Z selection, the two electrons should fall into the ECAL 
fiducial (which excludes the 1.44-1.57 region). 

Q:
24) LL736-740: why not use two muons per event to derive the template? What's the rational of using 
just one in a hardly random scheme you have developed? Have you checked that the numbers of even and 
odd events in the data are indeed roughly equal?
A:
We use actually two muons, and it's explained in the text: "for one of the two daughter muons...". 
The "randomness" is needed to chose which muon to take to mimic the SA candidate. 
See also similar comment from S. Malvezzi. 

Q:
25) L820: the 0.3\% uncertainty assigned to account for residual correlations is by far the largest 
uncertainty in the background modeling. How do we know that the 0.3\% number is indeed a conservative 
estimate and how was it derived?
A:
The fixed shape QCD template is constructed by inverting the track-cluster matching variable 
DeltaEta ("anti-selection"). A correlation between DeltaEta and pfMET can lead to a difference in the 
shape of the pfMET distribution for background events passing the selection (true QCD distribution) 
and anti-selection (QCD template). The correlation between pfMET and DeltaEta was studied and found 
to be quite small. An earlier version of the analysis involved a cut on DeltaPhi, for which a 
significantly larger correlation with pfMET was observed. The correlation was strong enough that it 
resulted in a clearly visible discrepancy between the data and the sum of templates in the background 
dominated region at low pfMET. In this case the bias on the signal yield was quantified and found to 
be 0.9%. Given that the observed correlation between deltaEta and pfMET is significantly smaller, 
together with the fact that the shape of the data matches the sum of templates extremely well in the 
background dominated region, we estimate that any bias on the signal yield due to the correlation 
between deltaEta and pfMET should not be more than around 0.3%. 

Q:
26) LL917-919: why the variation of the scales yields THREE different results. I expect eight 
(plus the central value), given that each of the scales should be allowed to change independently. 
Please, explain, how the scales are varied.
A:
Renormalization scale is assumed to be equal to the factorization scale. So, central value + two extreme 
values = three values. Stated explicitly in the text, and made it less ambiguous. 

Q:
27) L949: could you please explain what this sentence mean? Does it mean that you do not subtract 
the DY contribution from under the Z-peak? Why not? Easy to do via the sideband method...
A:
The gamma* contribution can't be subtracted using sidebands because of the interference and because 
of the very large tails of the Breit-Wigner. Our measurement includes this contribution, 
as well as the theoretical predictions we are comparing with. 

Q:
28) LL953-954 and LL958-959: naturally, the lepton ID efficiency is 100% correlated between the 
channels that deal with the same final state flavor lepton. Why this correlation has not been 
taken into account in the combination. How big of an effect could this have?
A:
The combination is done for different lepton flavours, as clearly written in the text: "The two 
different decay channels are combined by assuming fully correlated uncertainty for the acceptance 
factor, with other uncertainties assumed uncorrelated." 

Q:
29) L966: here you also need to state the 1.44-1.57 |eta| gap for the electrons. 
Ditto for the top entry in the last column of Table 19.
A:
No. Here we multiply the total cross sections with acceptances defined exactly as it is written. 
In this calculation the gaps are not excluded. Same for Table 19. 

Q:
3) The CMS Detector, L58: add a comma before "and"; L59: delete "(HCAL)" here: first of all you 
don't use the acronym anymore; second, HCAL includes HF, which is not brass/scintillator.
A:
We actually use HCAL in the following...(e.g.. HCAL isolation, I_HCAL)


Best regards,
Georgios and Luca
