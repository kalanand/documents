Dear Albert, 

Thank you very much for the useful suggestions and the numerous corrections you sent us.

We implemented the vast majority of, if not all, the editorial comments that we received.
In some cases, comments from different reviewers overlap or suggest incompatible changes.
In many of those and other cases the best solution was to rephrase the sentence or
paragraph involved. The number of editorial comments, due to the size of the paper, is too
large to give a reply for every single comment.

Here we collect some questions that we think are necessary to address:

Q:
it does read a little too much as a collection of largely independent analyses put together. 
The muon and electron analyses sometimes take different choices for no seemingly good reason, 
eg for the Z cross section extraction we use the cut and count for the e+e- which is a method 
we do not even try for the mumu. What you need here is a bit more upfront motivation for the 
strategies followed int the paper/analysis. 
A:
the cut and count was tried for mumu with smaller statistics and proven to be less precise. 
For this reason it has not been pursued further. We added few sentences to address these issues.

Q:
One important issue is that we upfront say exactly and precisely what cross section we measure, 
since this is a precision measurement, thus leaving no trace of doubt. Eg how do we treat QED FSR 
in these measurements, and what should theorists do to compare exactly with our results. The 
conveners may remember I once sent them a communication of a discussion between ATLAS and TH 
(reresented by Frank Kraus) on exactly this matter when ATLAS prepared for its first publication 
last year... 
A:
The fiducial cross sections are estimated from the total cross sections by multiplying with 
QED FSR corrected acceptances. This is done in order to have direct comparisons with NNLO restricted 
cross section predictions which do not contain QED FSR corrections. It is clearly mentioned
in the paper.

Q:
line 38 (more to RobertoT) do we HAVE to refer to ATLAS conference notes? do they refer to 
our PASes? Can we actually show the ATLAS values in fig 27, ie can we publish their values 
before they do? Also the number on the systematic given there in the caption is purely due 
to their more aggressive take for the lumi uncertainty, and not a consequence of more clever work 
on the cross section extraction, so I would not stress that number here without explaining more... 
A:
Removed comparison to ATLAS from Fig. according to CMS rule not to cite conf. notes. 

Q:
Fig 1 looking at this at face value we see the data behaving quite different from the signal MC. 
Nothing is said on that either in the figure or text. Maybe a sentence to re-assure the reader 
here that things are all right may help? 
A:
Data is Signal+Background while MC is pure Signal. Obviously they will have some differences 
which motivate the cut on the particular variable.

Q:
table 1: is it obvious why the W acceptance is better for the electron channel, while the reverse 
is true for the Z acceptance? Maybe worth a comment around line 259. 
A:
The W acceptance is higher for electrons because of the larger fiducial volume : |eta|<2.5 for 
electrons and |eta|<2.1 for muons. For Z the looser Pt cut on muons (20 GeV instead of 25 GeV for 
electrons) compensates for the smaller fiducial volume and gives a bit higher acceptance for muons. 

Q:
line 290: no opposite charge is fixed for the pairs, but was it checked that the like-sign 
charges we get are roughly what we expect from the MC? (we say something at the end on 
line 625 and further, but this comes late when the reader can have the question here. 
If this is the answer put at least a pointer to section "9.0.1") 
A:
Why we need this check against MC? We don't use it anywhere in the analysis.

Q:
line 423: tt and diboson background will be negligible, but maybe it is useful to say to 
what you fix the cross sections (NLO? measurements, quasi NNLO...)) 
A:
My impression is that we used NLO (to be cross checked). 

Q:
line 432: did we say somewhere in the paper what tune is used for the underlying event? 
Maybe should be added to --the present- section 4? 
A:
That would be useful. We need a reference for this. It is not added yet.

Q:
Fig 8: bottom parts of the plot are not explained in the caption (they are in the text). 
Either add or refer to the text 
A:
In the text we explain the definition of the bottom parts and we say that it stays the same 
for all plots. This is done on purpose in order to avoid explaining again & again the same 
thing. So if we add it here we 'll have to add it everywhere which is what we would like to avoid. 

Q:
line 990: We mention ATLAS here but we do not show their data, so no need to mention I suppose. 
See also comments above for 
Fig 27. 
A:
Removed comparison to ATLAS from Fig. according to CMS rule not to cite conf. notes. 


Thank you once more for your time and effort to read and improve this paper.

All the best,
