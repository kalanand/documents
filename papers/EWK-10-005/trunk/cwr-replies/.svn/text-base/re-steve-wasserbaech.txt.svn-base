Dear Steve,

thanks for your comments, they helped improve the quality of the paper. 

For what concerns rest of editorial comments, we implemented the vast majority of, 
if not all, the editorial comments that we received. In some cases, comments from 
different reviewers overlap or suggest incompatible changes. In many of those and 
other cases we found as the best solution to rephrase the sentence or paragraph 
involved. The number of editorial comments, due to the size of the paper, is too 
large to give a reply for every single comment. The latest posted draft contains 
almost all editorial changes.

Below the replies to the non-editorial and main editorial comments.

Q:
[ introduction section ] [...] These sentences should be combined and reorganized. 
How about a reference for the HERA and Tevatron data?
A:
we rephrased and improved the entire introduction 

Q:
lines 100-102: reword this sentence; it says that the HLT requires ET to be well 
below 25 GeV! And the part about "using the full" needs to be attached in a clearer way.
A:
Rephrased as: "They subsequently must pass an HLT filter that requires an ECAL cluster 
with $\et$ well below the offline $\et$ threshold of 25 GeV using the $\et$ measurements 
corrected by offline calibration and the full ECAL granularity~\cite{CMS-PAS-EGM-10-003}." 

Q:
OK for the W, but why is it [di-boson production] considered a background in the Z analysis?
A:
We would like to perform a measurement that is directly comparable with the NNLO predictions. 
Tools like FEWZ do not include di-bosons, so we decided to treat them as backgrounds.  

Q:
line 169: why does this variable have such a peculiar name?!
A:
It is a convention followed by egamma group.

Q:
fig 1: the left plot in the third row has a bin size of 0.0003 but the vertical axis label says 0.0006.
A:
We rebinned so now the label is correct. 

Q:
fig 3 caption: explain what the horizontal line and arrow mean
A:
Added: "The vertical arrow shows the cut applied to reject cosmic muons. The horizontal line shows 
the average of the bins with $d_{xy}>0.2~\mathrm{cm}$ used to estimate the (negligible) cosmic 
contamination in the signal region." 

Q:
line 229: "no requirement about the tracker-muon algorithm" is unclear.
A:
Rephrased: "no requirement that the muon must be reconstructed through the tracker-muon algorithm is applied" 

Q:
line 240: "masked" is jargon
A:
Changed to: "noisy or malfunctioning towers in the ECAL removed from the reconstruction" 

Q:
We avoid using "cut" and "template" in CMS papers, but those occur frequently in this draft.
A:
Replaced with alternative words throughout the text 

Q:
lines 330-333: replace the sentence with something like this: "Half of the maximum difference 
between the multibin and two-bin corrected efficiencies is taken as an additional systematic 
uncertainty on the two-bin efficiencies used to estimate the cross sections."
A:
We prefer to keep it like that in order to better motivate our choice. 

Q:
Fig. 8: The lower plots should be explained here, in the caption.
A:
To avoid explaining the lower plots in every figure, we mentioned their definition once 
(lines 450-452) and kept the same definition throughout the paper. 

Q:
I feel strongly that something needs to be said here to address the point that the background 
fractions are different in W+, W-, and the combined W+- samples! I assume the fractions given 
here are for the combined samples, and that you assume the backgrounds to be equal in the W+ and W- samples...
A:
We give only the W+- as an example of the background sizes. The W->taunu background is different in W+ and W- 
since it is of the same nature as the signal. The other backgrounds are more or less charge symmetric or 
too small to make a difference. 

Q:
Write "Arbitrary units" instead of "a.u." (astronomical units)
A:
Done. 

Q:
fig 15: please improve the appearance of this figure. Draw the arrows from the origin--the lines used to 
make the arrows are clearly thicker than the other lines. The arrows should also extend much farther 
beyond the regions, so there is more than 1 mm of space before the arrow heads. The labels on the cuts 
are in a weak font. Why don't we label the axes Itrk/pT and ETslash instead of X and Y, saving the 
reader some trouble? Region E doesn't seem to be used. The text implies that regions C and D have no 
upper edge. fig 15 caption: "five" instead of "5"
A:
the figure has been completely restyled.

Q:
line 539: "numbers" instead of "number"; line 539: "several" instead of "a number of" [or delete those 
words altogether]; line 540: "auxiliary" is misspelled; line 541: "fractions" instead of "fraction"; 
line 541: how about "misidentified" instead of "fake"?; lines 541-542: comma before and 
after "respectively"; line 542: "that" instead of "which"; line 543: comma before "all" but not 
after "all"; lines 543-544: "related" instead of "relating"; line 546: "obtained with" 
instead of "selected using"; line 547: delete "assigned"; line 548: "This contribution is small 
and is dominated"; line 551: "to pass the selection on $\MET$"; lines 551-552: comma instead of 
"which is"; line 554: "which" instead of "this"; line 556: "(i.e.\ before final..."; line 557: what 
does "tuned" mean? (tell the reader); line 558: "scaled with the signal yield through an iterative 
method."; lines 558-559: please rewrite this sentence ("The extracted...") yield of what? (tell the 
reader); Do we mean, "The extracted [signal/background] yield depends on the choice of the region 
boundaries because..."?; line 562: "controlled" is not the correct word. Small? Correctly estimated?
A:
The section is re-written and hopefully improved. 


Best regards,
Georgios and Luca
