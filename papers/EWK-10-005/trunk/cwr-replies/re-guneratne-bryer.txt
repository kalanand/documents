Dear Guneratne,

thanks for your comments, they helped improve the quality of the paper. 

For what concerns rest of editorial comments, we implemented the vast majority of, 
if not all, the editorial comments that we received. In some cases, comments from 
different reviewers overlap or suggest incompatible changes. In many of those and 
other cases we found as the best solution to rephrase the sentence or paragraph 
involved. The number of editorial comments, due to the size of the paper, is too 
large to give a reply for every single comment. The latest posted draft contains 
almost all of such editorial changes.

Below the replies to the non-editorial and main editorial comments.

Q: 
The muon selection subchapter refers to a CMS PAS on muon reconstruction and identification [16]. 
Is there a similar PAS for electron reconstruction and identification, which could be 
given as a reference for subchapter 5.2 on electron (tight and loose) selection?
A:
It is CMS PAS EGM-10-004 that we could quote for the electron reconstruction and identification. 
It is based on 200/nb and contains the tight & loose selections as WP80 and WP95. Maybe it is 
a bit confusing for the reader. Not decided yet what to do.

Q: 
Line 296: Reference for asymmetric resolution function (Crystal Ball)?
A:
Added reference [17] 

Q: 
Lines 366-367: "This behaviour is not fully reproduced by the MC". Could we indicate which kind 
of effects would have to be implemented in the MC in order to reproduce better the data? Alignment, 
edge inefficiencies?
A:
We don't rely on MC for efficiency estimates, so we don't need to motivate the MC imperfections. 

Q: 
Lines 447-452: The residual distributions shown at the bottom of Fig. 8 are not very useful. 
In particular the ratio of the systematic error to the statistical error (residual distributions 
(red and blue) Fig. 8 right bottom) is of no interest. What one wants is the total uncertainty 
(syst + stat) on the signal template MET shape used in the fit. One possibility is to keep 
only the plot on the left of Fig. 8 and replace the residual (chi) plot by a plot of the ratio 
(correction factor) of the corrected shape to the simulated shape and its total estimated 
(stat + syst) error. Residual plots are only useful to compare histograms and fitted curves 
such as in Fig.9, 10 and others. One would have to move their definition (Lines 450-452) to 
the next subchapter 8.3, when discussing Fig. 9 for example.
A:
We agree that the residual distributions are not so useful. From the other side it is a 
quick way to aid the eye spotting differences between the presented distributions. 

Q: 
Lines 540-544: Completely obscure. Fraction of fake electrons is ambiguous. A priori there 
are 4 (not 2) different fractions of fake electrons in the 4 regions ABCD: fA, fB, fC and fD? 
Only after reading the note AN2011_009_v6.pdf one can understand what is meant. Here is a 
suggestion to simplify the text, replacing the two sentences Lines 540-544 by: 
"In this formulation, two of these parameters are the relative numbers of fake electrons 
(QCD background)reconstructed in the AB and CD regions: QA/QB and QD/QC. By assuming that 
these two parameters are equal (factorization) the number of signal events can be extracted 
from the system of equations independently of the number of QCD background events."
A:
Changed to : "In this formulation, two parameters, f_A and f_D, relate to the QCD backgrounds 
and are defined as the ratios of events with a fake electron candidate in the A and D regions 
to the number in the AB and CD regions respectively, representing the efficiency with which 
fake electrons pass the boundary on MET dividing AD from BC. If the efficiency for passing 
the MET boundary is largely independent of the choice of the boundaries on I_trk/ET then 
these two parameters will be approximately equal. Assuming f_A = f_D holds exactly leads 
to a simplification of the system of equations such that all direct dependence of the signal 
extraction on parameters relating to the QCD backgrounds is eliminated." 

Q: 
Lines 617-630: The errors on QCD background estimates are dominated by large systematic errors. 
Only because of these large errors are the two estimates compatible. It would be nice 
(in particular for the SS/OS method) to explain how these systematic errors have been estimated.
A:
Since this is only a cross check we don't want to discuss it extensively in this paragraph. 

Q: 
Lines 767-772: Not easy to understand. Not clear that this is useful. Are the systematic 
uncertainties of 0.3% (selection) and 1% (reconstruction) already included in the 1.4% total 
systematic uncertainty for the W->e nu cross-section? These numbers do not appear in Table 11. 
Drop it all or rewrite more clearly?
A:
Yes they are. Should not appear in table 11 as a separate entry. The systematic uncertainty quoted 
for the electron reconstruction & identification includes the statistical uncertainty related 
to the size of the Z sample used to estimate the efficiencies. 

Q: 
Lines 861-864: Add a sentence: The effect of this uncertainty of 1.5% was propagated to the 
fitted W contribution and found negligible.
A:
Actually the sentence was a left-over from a previous version, and was not correct, 
so it has been has been removed 

Q: 
Fig. 27 caption: suppress the sentence "The solid symbols [] and the hollow symbols[]". The total 
uncertainty looks bigger for ATLAS than for CMS. This is not in agreement with the caption: "3.4% for ATLAS 
and 4% for CMS". In ATLAS-CONF-2011-041 one finds a total error of 5.1 % for sigma(W) and 5.4% for sigma(Z). 
That is in an average total uncertainty of 5.2% for ATLAS compared to 4% for CMS.
A:
Removed comparison to ATLAS from Fig. according to CMS rule not to cite conf. notes.
