\section{Introduction}
This note describes the measurement in pp collisions at
$\sqrt{s} = 7~\TeV$ of the inclusive production cross section for W
and Z bosons, observed via their decay to electrons and muons, and
additionally presents selected cross section ratios.

We used the data-taking periods from 2010 LHC operations
passing the standard CMS quality criteria, which allow no anomalous or
faulty behavior for the inner tracker, the calorimeters,
and the muon chambers.

W and the Z production cross sections have been 
previously measured by ATLAS~\cite{WZATLAS:2010} with
an integrated luminosity of 320~nb$^{-1}$ and by 
CMS~\cite{WZCMS:2010} with an integrated luminosity of 2.9~pb$^{-1}$. 
We present here an update with the full luminosity recorded at the LHC 
in 2010 corresponding to 36~pb$^{-1}$.
