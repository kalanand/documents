We apply various selection criteria to remove instrumental background and noise from the objects for the measurement.
The events must have at least one good primary vertex as described in Sec.~\ref{sec:reconstruction}. 
Furthermore, backgrounds from beam interactions 
are removed by applying high purity tracking requirements on charged tracks.
Finally, calorimeter noise is removed by timing and pulse shape selections on the calorimeter signals. 


For the dijet event selection, events are required to have at least two AK7 jets with
$\pt > 50$ \GeV and $|y| < 2.5$
and each jet must satisfy the jet quality criteria explained in~\cite{particleflow}.

For the V+jet event selection,
reconstruction of W and Z bosons begins with the identification
and selection of charged leptons and MET described in the previous 
section. 
Candidate \ZtoLL\ decays are reconstructed by combining 
isolated electrons and muons and requiring the dilepton invariant 
mass to satisfy $80<M_{\ell\ell}<100\GeV$.  

Candidate \WtoLN\ decays are identifed primarily by the topology
of a single isolated lepton with high $\pt$ and additional missing energy, with the selection described in section~\ref{evrecosection}.  The
transverse momentum \ptW\ and transverse mass \mtW\ of the W candidate are obtained combining the lepton and the MET transverse momenta.

The jet mass analysis in V+jet event is carried on in a boosted kinematic regime, namely $\pt $(V)$> 120$ GeV. We further require the leading jet in the event (independently for each clustering algorithm and jet radius) to have $\pt >$ 125 GeV.
The back-to-back topology between the vector boson and the leading jet is ensured by the additional selections $\Delta \phi(V,\rm{jet})>2$ and $\Delta R (\ell,\rm{jet})>1$. 
Requiring a boosted regime, in addition to the tight isolation cuts on the leptons, effectively suppresses the QCD background.
In the \WtoLN\ +jet analysis, further QCD rejection is achieved by requiring MET $>$ 50 GeV and $M_T$(W)$>$ 50 GeV.

Figure~\ref{fig:Vjetpt} shows the leading AK7 jet $\pt$ distribution in Z and W plus jet events after the selection described above has been applied.

 Given the unique signature of a highly boosted vector 
boson recoiling from jets, the minimal selection described above is sufficient to 
identify highly pure samples of V+jet events. The W+jet sample is about 82\% pure, with background contributions from $\mathrm{t\bar{t}}$ (13\%), single top (3\%), di-boson and Z+jet (1\% each) events.
In the Z$(\ell\ell)$+jet ($\ell=$ e,$\mu$) analysis the additional constraint on the di-lepton mass removes almost completely these background contributions, giving a purity of about 99\%, with 1\% contamination from di-boson events. These backgrounds are subtracted based on their MC prediction from the jet mass distributions before correcting for detector effects.
