In the following, we show the unfolded data distributions for the different jet algorithms under study, comapared to the MC expectations from Madgraph and Herwig++. In all distributions, the MC is normalized to the data. The distributions are integrated in the jet momentum. Appendix~\ref{allPlots} shows the distributions binned in the 4 jet $p_T$ regions defined above.
We report normalized cross-sections, i.e. $1/sigma*(d/sigma/dM_J)$ in order to cancel luminosity dependence.
The MC is found to reproduce pretty well the data, with some residual poor modeling at low mass (that is also the most sensitive region to PU effects). It is also interesting to observe that the more aggressive the grooming is, the more herwig seems to better reproduce the data than madgraph/pythia.
