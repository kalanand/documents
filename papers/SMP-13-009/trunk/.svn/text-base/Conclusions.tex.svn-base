\section{Summary}
\label{sec:summary}

   A study of the WV$\gamma$ three electroweak bosons production and
   the anomalous quartic gauge boson couplings has been presented,
   based on events containing a W boson decaying to leptons, a second
   boson V (V = W or Z) decaying to two jets, and a photon. The data
   analyzed corresponds to an integrated luminosity of up to 19.3~fb$^{-1}$ 
   collected in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 8~TeV in 2012 with the
   CMS detector at the LHC. An upper limit of 311~fb at 95\% confidence level is obtained for 
   the production of WV$\gamma$ with photon $E_T >$~30~GeV and $|\eta|<1.44$.  No evidence of anomalous
   WW$\gamma\gamma$ and WWZ$\gamma$ quartic gauge couplings is
   found. The following upper limits are obtained for these couplings at 95\% confidence level:

\begin{align*}
   -21 &< a_{0}^{W}/\Lambda^{2} < 20 \unit{TeV}^{-2}, \\
   -34 &< a_{C}^{W}/\Lambda^{2} < 32 \unit{TeV}^{-2}, \\
   -25 &< f_{T,0}/\Lambda^{4} < 24 \unit{TeV}^{-4}, \\
   -12 &< \kappa_{0}^{W}/\Lambda^{2} < 10 \unit{TeV}^{-2} \textrm{, and} \\
   -18 &< \kappa_{C}^{W}/\Lambda^{2} < 17 \unit{TeV}^{-2}.
\end{align*}

   These are the first experimental limits reported on $f_{T,0}$ and the CP-conserving couplings $\kappa_0^W$ and $\kappa_C^W$.
