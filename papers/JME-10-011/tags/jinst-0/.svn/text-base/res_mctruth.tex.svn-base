\subsection{Monte Carlo  Resolutions}
\label{sec:res_mctruth}
%
The jet \pt resolution derived from generator-level MC information   
information in the simulation, serves as a benchmark for the measurements 
of the jet resolution in collision data samples, 
using the methods introduced above and discussed in the following sections.

The measurement of the jet \pt resolution in the simulation is performed using {\sc pythia} QCD dijet
events. The MC particle jets are matched geometrically to the reconstructed jets (CALO, JPT, or PF) by requiring
their distance in $\eta-\phi$ space to be $\Delta R < \Delta R_{Max}$.

The jet \pt response is defined as the ratio $\pt^{reco}/\pt^{gen}$
where $\pt^{reco}$ and $\pt^{gen}$ refer to the transverse momenta  
of the reconstructed jet and its matched reference MC particle jet respectively.

The width of the jet \pt response distribution, in a given $|\eta|$ and
$\pt^{gen}$ bin, is interpreted as the generator-level MC jet \pt 
resolution.  Figure~\ref{fig:fit-example} shows an example of 
$\pt^{reco}/\pt^{gen}$ distribution for CALO jets
in $|\eta|<0.5$ and with $250<\pt^{gen}<320\GeV$.
