A search for narrow resonances in the dijet mass spectrum 
is performed using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.9 pb$^{-1}$ collected 
by the CMS experiment at the LHC. Upper limits at the 95\% confidence level (CL) are presented on the product of the resonance cross 
section, branching fraction into dijets, and acceptance, separately for decays into 
quark-quark, quark-gluon, or gluon-gluon pairs. The data 
exclude new particles predicted in the following models at the 
95\% CL: string resonances, with mass less than 2.50~TeV, excited quarks, with mass less than 1.58~TeV, 
and axigluons, colorons, and $\mbox{E}_6$ diquarks, in specific mass intervals. This extends previously 
published limits on these models.}

Two or more energetic jets arise in proton-proton collisions 
when partons are scattered with large transverse 
momenta, \pt.  The invariant mass spectrum of the two jets with 
largest \pt (dijets) falls steeply and smoothly, as predicted by quantum
chromodynamics (QCD). Many extensions of the standard model predict the existence of new massive objects
that couple to quarks ($q$) and gluons ($g$), and result in resonant structures 
in the 
dijet mass.  In this Letter we report a search for narrow 
resonances in the dijet mass spectrum, measured with the CMS detector~\cite{refCMS} at the LHC, at a proton-proton 
collision energy of $\sqrt{s}=7$~TeV. 

In addition to this generic search, we search for 
narrow s-channel dijet resonances from eight specific models.
First, string resonances ($S$), which are Regge excitations of quarks and gluons in string 
theory, with multiple mass-degenerate spin states and 
quantum numbers~\cite{Anchordoqui:2008di,Cullen:2000ef}; string resonances with mass
$\sim 2$ TeV are expected to decay predominantly to $qg$ (91\%) with small amounts of $gg$ (5.5\%) and 
$q\bar{q}$ (3.5\%).
Second, mass-degenerate excited quarks ($q^*$), which decay to
$qg$, predicted if quarks are composite~\cite{ref_qstar}; the compositeness scale is set to be equal to the mass of the excited quark.
Third, axial vector particles called axigluons ($A$), which decay to  $q\bar{q}$, 
predicted in a model where the symmetry group $\hbox{SU(3)}$ of QCD is replaced by the 
chiral symmetry ${\hbox{SU(3)}_{\rm L}} \times {\hbox{SU(3)}_{\rm R}}$~\cite{ref_axi}.
Fourth, color-octet colorons ($C$), also decaying to  $q\bar{q}$, predicted by the flavor-universal 
coloron model embedding the $\hbox{SU(3)}$ symmetry of QCD in 
a larger gauge group~\cite{ref_coloron}.
Fifth, scalar diquarks ($D$), which decay to $qq$ and $\bar{q}\bar{q}$, predicted by a grand unified theory based on 
the $\mbox{E}_6$ gauge~\cite{ref_diquark}.
Sixth, Randall-Sundrum (RS) gravitons ($G$), which decay to $q\bar{q}$ and $gg$, predicted in the RS model 
of extra dimensions~\cite{ref_rsg}; the value of the dimensionless coupling
$\kappa/\overline{M}_{\rm Pl}$ is chosen to be 0.1.
Seventh and eighth, new 
gauge bosons ($W^\prime$ and $Z^\prime$), which decay to $q\bar{q}$, 
predicted by models that propose new gauge symmetries~\cite{ref_gauge};
the $W^\prime$ and $Z^\prime$ resonances
are assumed to have standard-model-like couplings.


A detailed description of the CMS experiment can be found 
elsewhere~\cite{refCMS}.
The CMS coordinate system has the origin at the center of the detector. 
The $z$-axis points along the direction of the counterclockwise beam, with the transverse 
plane perpendicular to the beam; $\phi$ is the azimuthal 
angle in radians, $\theta$ is the polar angle and the pseudorapidity is 
$\eta \equiv -\ln(\tan[\theta/2])$. 
The central feature of the CMS apparatus is a superconducting solenoid of 6 m 
internal diameter. 
Within the field volume are the silicon pixel and strip tracker ($|\eta|<2.4$), and the barrel and
endcap calorimeters ($|\eta|<3$): a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) and
a brass-scintillator hadronic calorimeter (HCAL).
Outside the field volume, in the forward region, there is 
an iron-quartz fiber calorimeter ($3<|\eta|<5$).
The ECAL and HCAL cells are grouped into towers, projecting radially outward from 
the origin, for triggering purposes and to facilitate jet reconstruction.  
In the region 
$|\eta|<1.74$ these projective calorimeter towers have segmentation 
$\Delta\eta = \Delta\phi = 0.087$; the $\eta$ and $\phi$ width 
increases at higher values of $\eta$. 
The energy depositions measured in the ECAL and the 
HCAL within each projective tower are summed to find the calorimeter tower energy.
%Towers with $|\eta|<1.3$ contain only cells from the barrel 
%calorimeters, towers in the transition region $1.3<|\eta|<1.5$ contain a mixture of 
%barrel and endcap cells, and towers in the region $1.5<|\eta|<3.0$ 
%contain only cells from the endcap calorimeters. 

The integrated luminosity of the data sample selected for this
analysis is $2.9 \pm 0.3$~pb$^{-1}$~\cite{EWK-10-004-PAS}.  A single-jet trigger is used in both the online
hardware-level (L1) and the software-level (HLT) of the trigger system~\cite{refCMS} to select an unprescaled 
sample of events with a nominal jet transverse energy threshold at the HLT of 50~GeV.
%Another single-jet trigger with a lower $p_{\rm T}$ threshold with a prescaling of
%events is used for the purpose of computing trigger efficiencies.
The trigger efficiency for this analysis is measured from the data
to be larger than 99.5\% for dijet masses above 220~GeV.
%~\cite{EXO-10-010-PAS}.
%This analysis includes all 
%dijet mass data above a threshold of 220~GeV.
%The minimum dijet mass used in this analysis, 220~GeV, is the lower edge of
%one of the a priori defined bins determined by the dijet mass resolution.
%and is synchronized to a concurrent
%analysis of the dijet centrality ratio~\cite{EXO-10-002-PAS}.


Jets are reconstructed using the anti-$k_T$ algorithm~\cite{1126-6708-2008-04-063} with a distance 
parameter $R=0.7$. The reconstructed jet energy $E$ is defined as the scalar
sum of the calorimeter tower energies inside the jet. The jet momentum $\vec{p}$ is the 
corresponding vector sum of the tower energies using the tower directions.
The $E$ and $\vec{p}$ of a reconstructed jet are corrected as a function of \pt and $\eta$ for the 
non-linearity and inhomogeneity of the calorimeter response. 
The correction is between 43\% and 15\% for jets with corrected \pt between $0.1$ and 
$1.0$ TeV in the region $|\eta|<1.3$.
The jet energy corrections were determined and validated using simulations, test beam data,
and collision data~\cite{JME-10-003-PAS}.

The dijet system is composed of the 
two jets with the highest \pt in an event (leading jets). 
We require that the pseudorapidity separation 
of the two leading jets, $\Delta\eta=\eta_1-\eta_2$, satisfies  
$|\Delta\eta|<1.3$, and that both jets be in the region 
$|\eta|<2.5$. These $\eta$ cuts maximize the search sensitivity for 
isotropic decays of dijet resonances in the presence of QCD background.
The dijet mass is given by 
$m=\sqrt{(E_1 + E_2)^2 - (\vec{p}_1 + \vec{p}_2)^2}$. 
We select events with $m>220$~GeV without any requirements on jet \pt.


To remove possible instrumental and non-collision 
backgrounds in the selected sample, the following selections are made.
Events are
required to have a reconstructed primary vertex within $|z|<24$ cm.
For jets, at least 1\% of the jet energy must be 
detected in the ECAL, at most 98\% can be measured in a single 
photodetection device of the HCAL readout, and at most 90\% 
can be measured in a single cell.
%Jets are required to have a minimum
%of 1\% of their total energy detected in the ECAL, a minimum
%multiplicity of two calorimeter cells, ECAL or HCAL, and a maximum 
%of 98\% of the total energy occurring in a single photodetection device
%of the hadron calorimeter readout. 
These criteria, which are fully efficient for dijets, remove 0.1\% of the events passing the pseudorapidity constraints 
and the dijet mass threshold.


Figure~\ref{fig1} presents the inclusive dijet mass 
distribution for $pp\rightarrow$ 2 leading jets + $X$, where $X$ can be 
anything, including additional jets. 
We plot the measured differential cross section versus dijet mass in 
bins approximately equal to the dijet mass resolution. 
The data are compared to a QCD prediction from PYTHIA~\cite{refPYTHIA}, which includes a simulation of the CMS  
detector and the jet energy corrections.  
The prediction uses  a renormalization scale $\mu=\pt$ and CTEQ6L1 parton distribution functions~\cite{refCTEQ}. 
The PYTHIA prediction agrees with the data within the jet energy scale uncertainty, which is the dominant 
systematic uncertainty. 
To test the smoothness of our measured cross section as a function of dijet mass, we 
fit the data with the parameterization

\begin{equation}
\frac{{\rm d}\sigma}{{\rm d}m} = 
\frac{P_{0} (1 - m/\sqrt{s})^{P_{1}}}{(m/\sqrt{s})^{P_{2} + P_{3} \ln{(m/\sqrt{s})}}}\ ,
\end{equation}

with four free parameters $P_0$, $P_1$, $P_2$ and $P_3$. This functional form 
has been used by prior searches to describe both data and QCD predictions~\cite{refCDFrun2,ATLAS_search}.
In Fig.~\ref{fig1} we show both the data and the fit, 
which has a $\chi^2=32$ for 31 degrees of freedom.  In Fig.~\ref{fig2} we show
the ratio between the data and the fit.  The data are well described by 
the smooth parameterization.

 We search for narrow resonances, for which the
natural resonance width is negligible compared to the CMS dijet mass 
resolution. Figures~\ref{fig1} and \ref{fig2} present the 
predicted dijet mass distribution for string resonances and excited quarks using the 
PYTHIA Monte Carlo and the CMS detector simulation.
The predicted mass distributions exhibit a Gaussian core from 
jet energy resolution and a tail toward low masses from QCD radiation.
% The dijet mass distribution of narrow dijet resonances depends on 
%the type of partons coming from the resonance decay, because this affects both the 
%amount of radiation and the final state jet response in
%the CMS detector.
This can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig3}, which shows examples of the predicted dijet mass distribution of resonances from
three different parton pairings: $q\bar{q}$ (or $qq$) resonances 
from the process $G \rightarrow q\bar{q}$~\cite{ref_rsg}, 
$qg$ resonances from $q^* \rightarrow qg$~\cite{ref_qstar},
and $gg$ resonances from $G \rightarrow gg$~\cite{ref_rsg}. 
For resonance masses between 0.5 and 2.5 TeV, the dijet mass resolution 
varies from 8\% to 5\% for $qq$, 10\% to 6\% for $qg$, and 16\% to 10\% 
for $gg$, respectively.
%In the case of qg resonances, the dijet mass resolution varies 
%from 10\% at 0.5 TeV to 6\% at 2.5 TeV.
The increase of the 
width of the measured mass shape and the shift of the mass 
distribution toward lower masses are enhanced when the number of 
gluons in the final state is larger, because QCD radiation is larger 
for gluons than for quarks.  The latter also implies that the 
detector response is lower to gluon jets than to quark jets~\cite{JME-07-002-PAS} (jet 
energy corrections, applied both to data and to simulations, are for 
the mixture of quark and gluon jets expected in QCD). The distributions  
in Fig. 3 are generically valid for other resonances with the 
same parton content and with a natural width small compared to the dijet mass 
resolution.
%These 
%resonance shapes are approximately valid for any resonance model involving these pairs 
%of partons, assuming that the resonance's natural width is small compared 
%to the dijet mass resolution. 
%The reconstructed width of dijet resonances increases with the number of gluons in the 
%final state, primarily
%because gluons emit more radiation than quarks.  The peak value of the dijet mass for 
%the resonance decreases with the number of final state gluons, primarily due 
%to the lower response of the CMS detector to gluon jets than to quark jets~\cite{JME-07-002-PAS}.  
%The generic jet corrections, which we apply to both the data and all simulations, 
%are for the mixture of quarks and gluons expected in QCD dijet production.
 There is no indication 
of narrow resonances in our data as shown in Figs.~\ref{fig1} and ~\ref{fig2}.

We use the dijet mass data points, the background (QCD) parameterization, and the 
dijet resonance shapes to set specific limits on new particles decaying to
the parton pairs $qq$ (or $q\bar{q}$), $qg$, and $gg$.
For setting upper limits,
before accounting for systematic uncertainties, we use a Bayesian
formalism with a uniform prior for the signal cross section. 
We calculate the posterior probability density as a function of resonance cross section, 
independently at 22 different values of the resonance mass from 0.5 to 2.6 TeV
in steps of $0.1$~TeV. From this we find initial 95\% confidence level (CL) upper limits on the cross section, including only 
statistical uncertainties. The dominant sources of systematic uncertainty are the jet energy scale (10\%), the jet energy 
resolution (10\%), the integrated luminosity (11\%), and the background parameterization choice (included by using a different 
parameterization~\cite{Abe:1997hm} that also describes the data). 
The jet energy scale and resolution uncertainties are conservative estimates, 
consistent with those measured using collision data~\cite{JME-10-003-PAS}.
To incorporate systematic uncertainties, we then use an approximate technique, which in our
application is generally more conservative than a fully Bayesian
treatment.  The posterior probability density
for the cross section is broadened by convoluting it, for each resonance mass, with a Gaussian
systematic uncertainty~\cite{Abe:1997hm}.
As a result, the cross section limits including systematic uncertainties
increase by 17\%--49\% depending on the resonance mass and type.
%over the corresponding limits derived with statistical uncertainties alone.
Table~\ref{tab_limit} lists the generic upper limits at the 95\% CL on 
$\sigma\times\mbox{BR}\times\mbox{A}$, the product of
cross section ($\sigma$), branching fraction (BR), and acceptance (A) for the 
kinematic requirements $|\Delta\eta|<1.3$ and $|\eta|<2.5$, 
%cross section times branching fraction times acceptance 
for $qq$, $qg$, and $gg$ resonances. The acceptance for isotropic decays is 
$\mbox{A}\approx 0.6$ independent
of resonance mass.



In Fig.~\ref{fig4} we compare these upper limits to the model predictions as a function of resonance mass.
The predictions are from lowest order calculations of the product $\sigma\times\mbox{BR}\times\mbox{A}$ 
using the CTEQ6L1 parton distributions~\cite{refCTEQ}. New particles are excluded at the 95\% CL in 
mass regions for 
which the theory curve lies above our upper limit for the appropriate pair of
partons. 
We also determine the expected lower limit on the mass of each new particle, for a smooth background in the 
absence of signal.
For string resonances the expected mass limit is $2.40$~TeV, and we use the limits on $qg$ resonances to 
exclude the mass range $0.50 < M(S) < 2.50$~TeV.
For comparison, previous measurements~\cite{refCDFrun2} 
imply a limit on string resonances of about 1.4~TeV.
For excited quarks the expected mass limit is $1.32$~TeV, and we exclude the mass range $0.50<M(q^*)<1.58$~TeV,
extending the previous exclusion of $0.40<M(q^*)<1.26$~TeV~\cite{ATLAS_search}. 
For axigluons or colorons the expected mass limit is $1.23$~TeV,
and we use the limits on $qq$ resonances to exclude the mass intervals 
$0.50<M(A)<1.17$~TeV and $1.47<M(A)<1.52$~TeV, extending the
previous exclusion of $0.12<M(A)<1.25$~TeV~\cite{refCDFrun2}. For $\mbox{E}_6$ diquarks the expected 
mass limit is $1.05$~TeV, and we exclude the mass
intervals $0.50<M(D)<0.58$~TeV, and $0.97 < M(D) < 1.08$~TeV, and $1.45 < M(D) < 1.60$~TeV, 
extending the previous exclusion of $0.29<M(D)<0.63$~TeV~\cite{refCDFrun2}.
For $W^\prime$, $Z^\prime$ and RS gravitons we do not expect any mass limit, and do not exclude any mass intervals 
with the present data.
The systematic uncertainties included in this analysis reduce the excluded upper masses 
by roughly $0.1$~TeV for each type of new particle.

In conclusion, the measured dijet mass spectrum is a smoothly falling
distribution as expected within the standard model.  
We see no evidence for new particle production. Thus we present generic upper limits
on $\sigma\times\mbox{BR}\times\mbox{A}$ that can be applied to any model
of dijet resonances, 
and set specific mass limits on string resonances, excited quarks, axigluons, flavor universal colorons,  
and $\mbox{E}_6$ diquarks, all of which extend previous exclusions.
