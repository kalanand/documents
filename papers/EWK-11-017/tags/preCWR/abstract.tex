A study is presented of the invariant mass spectrum of the two jets
with the highest transverse momentum in $\text{pp}\rightarrow
\text{W+2-jet}$ and W+3-jet events.  The data sample
corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 5.0\,fb$^{-1}$ collected
with the CMS detector at $\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV.  An upper limit of
1.1\,pb at 95\% confidence level is established on the production
cross section times W$\to\ell\nu$ branching fraction for a generic
Gaussian signal peaked at 150~GeV.  Several theoretical models that
predict a resonant enhancement near 150\,GeV are excluded.
