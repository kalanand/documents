A study is presented of the invariant mass spectrum of the two jets
with highest transverse momentum in $\Pp\Pp \to \PW$+2-jet and
\PW+3-jet events.  The data sample corresponds to an integrated
luminosity of 5.0\,fb$^{-1}$ collected with the CMS detector at
$\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV. No evidence is found for the anomalous structure
reported by the CDF Collaboration, and an upper limit of 5.0\unit{pb}
is established at 95\% confidence level on the production cross
section for a generic Gaussian signal with mass near 150~GeV.  Two
theoretical models that predict a dijet resonance near 150\,GeV are
excluded.
