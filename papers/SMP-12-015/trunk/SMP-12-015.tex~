%%\section{Introduction}
The pair production of vector bosons allows a direct 
test of their self-interactions, which are fixed by the 
gauge symmetry of the standard model (SM)~\cite{PhysRevD.48.2182}. 
Observation of anomalous triple gauge boson couplings 
would be an indication of physics beyond the SM.
%%Also, the SM Higgs boson may decay to WW, giving rise to the same 
%%final state as in direct diboson production. 


In this Letter we report the first observation of WW+WZ diboson 
production in pp collisions in the semileptonic final state at 
the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), where 
one W boson decays leptonically ($\ell\nu$) while the other boson 
(W or Z) decays hadronically ($jj$), giving rise to two energetic jets in 
the final state.
Previous measurements in this channel at the Tevatron p$\bar{\rm p}$ 
collider include the recent CDF~\cite{CDF-diboson-lvjj-2010} and 
D\O~\cite{Abazov:2011cb, Abazov:2012} results. 
The advantage of reconstructing WW+WZ in the $\ell\nu jj$ decay mode over 
the purely leptonic final states~\cite{Chatrchyan:2011tz,:2012ks} is the larger branching fraction to jets, but
at the expense of larger backgrounds, mainly from W+jets production.
In contrast to the fully leptonic decay of WW pairs, the semileptonic 
process permits a direct measurement of the boson transverse 
momentum (\pt). 
Sensitivity to WW$\gamma$ coupling in WW production and WWZ 
coupling in WW and WZ production at high boson transverse momenta 
makes this process particularly 
useful as a probe of anomalous triple gauge boson couplings,  
where evidence of physics beyond the SM could appear.



The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of $5.0 \pm
0.1\fbinv$ collected in 2010 and 2011 with the Compact Muon Solenoid
(CMS) detector in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 7\TeV$ at the CERN
LHC. The CMS experiment~\cite{CMS:2010} uses a right-handed coordinate system, with
the origin at the nominal interaction point, the x-axis pointing to
the center of the LHC ring, the y-axis pointing up perpendicular to the 
plane of LHC ring, and the z-axis along the counterclockwise beam direction. The
polar angle $\theta$ is measured from the positive z-axis and the 
azimuthal angle $\phi$ is measured in the x-y plane. The
pseudorapidity is defined as $\eta = -\ln(\tan\frac{\theta}{2})$. The
central feature of the CMS apparatus is a superconducting solenoid of
6\unit{m} internal diameter, providing a magnetic field of
3.8\unit{T}. Within the field volume are a silicon pixel and strip
tracker and calorimeters. The tracker covers the range $|\eta| < 2.5$
which, together with the solenoid, provides a track momentum
resolution of 1\% at 100\GeVnn. The lead-tungstate crystal
electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) covers $|\eta| < 3$ with an energy
resolution of about $3\%/\sqrt{E}$~\cite{CMS-PAS-EGM-10-003}. The
brass/scintillator hadron calorimeter (HCAL) covers $|\eta| < 3.0$ with
an energy resolution of $100\%/\sqrt{E}$. The muon system includes the
tracker and gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel return
yoke, and is capable of reconstructing and identifying muons within
$|\eta| < 2.4$. Extensive forward calorimetry complements the coverage
provided by the barrel and endcap detectors. The detector is nearly
hermetic, allowing for measurements of the missing transverse energy
($\MET$) in the event.  A two-tier trigger system selects the events
of interest.


The data were collected with a suite of single-lepton triggers mostly 
using \pt thresholds of 24\GeVnn for muons 
and 25--32\GeVnn for electrons. 
To preferentially select events with on-shell W bosons, 
the single-electron triggers typically also require minimum 
thresholds on $\MET$ in the range 0--25\GeVnn and the
transverse mass \mt of the electron plus $\MET$ system in the range 0--50\GeVnn. 
The overall trigger efficiency is about 94\% (90\%) for muon (electron) data, 
with a small dependence of a few percent on \pt and $\eta$. 
Simulated events are corrected for the trigger efficiency as 
a function of lepton \pt and $\eta$, and in the case 
of electrons also as a function of $\MET$ .
Simulated events are used to 
develop and validate the methods used in the analysis. 


The {\MADGRAPH}5~1.3.30~\cite{MADGRAPH} event generator produces
parton-level events with a \PW\ boson and up to four partons on the
basis of matrix-element (ME) calculations.  The ME--parton shower (ME--PS) 
matching scale $\mu$ is taken to be 20\GeV~\cite{Hoche:2006ph}, and
the factorization and renormalization scales are both set to $q^2 =
M_{\PW}^2 + p_{\mathrm{T},\PW}^2$.  Samples of \ttbar\ and Drell--Yan
events are also generated with \MADGRAPH.  Single-top production is
modeled with \POWHEG~1.0~\cite{POWHEG}.  Multijet and diboson samples
(\PW\PW, \PW\cPZ, \cPZ\cPZ) are generated with
\PYTHIA~6.422~\cite{Sjostrand:2006za}.  \PYTHIA provides the parton
shower simulation in all cases, with parameters of the underlying
event set to the Z2 tune~\cite{PythiaTuneZ2}.  The set of parton
distribution functions used is \textsc{cteq6ll}~\cite{CTEQ}.
A \GEANTfour-based simulation~\cite{GEANT4} of the CMS
detector is used in the production of all Monte Carlo (MC)
samples. Multiple proton-proton interactions within a bunch crossing
are simulated, and the triggers are emulated.  All simulated
events are reconstructed and analyzed with the same software as data.




Events are selected with one well-identified and isolated lepton (muon
or electron), large missing transverse energy \met, and exactly 
high-\pt jets.
Muons are reconstructed with the inner tracker and the muon system  
within $|\eta|<2.1$~\cite{MUONPAS}. 
Electrons are reconstructed  from tracks in the tracker 
pointing to energy clusters in the ECAL, within $|\eta|<2.5$, 
excluding the transition region between the barrel and endcap, 
$1.44<|\eta|<1.57$~\cite{CMS-PAS-EGM-10-004}. 
Muons (electrons) are required to have \pt
greater than 25\GeVnn (35\GeVnn).
The lepton candidates are required to be compatible with coming from the primary 
vertex of the event, which is chosen as the vertex with the highest 
$\sum \pt^2$ of its associated tracks. According to the simulation,
this requirement provides the correct assignment for the primary 
vertex in more than 99\% of the cases
in both signal and background events. 
Charged leptons from 
W-boson decays are expected to 
be isolated from other activity in the event.
The sum of transverse momentum or energy in the tracker, ECAL, and HCAL, 
within a surrounding cone
of $\Delta R \equiv \sqrt{(\Delta\eta)^2+(\Delta\phi)^2} <0.3$, 
excluding the lepton itself, is required to be 
less than 10\% of the measured
$\pt$ of the muon, or less than 5\% of the measured $\pt$ of the electron. 
Here $\Delta\eta$ and
$\Delta\phi$ are the differences in pseudorapidity 
and in azimuthal angle, respectively.
To reduce the backgrounds from the Drell-Yan and electroweak diboson 
fully leptonic decays, we exclude events in which there is any other 
loosely identified lepton (with $\pt>10$\GeVnn for 
muons and $\pt > 20$\GeVnn for electrons) in the event.


Jets are reconstructed from calorimeter and tracker information using
a particle-flow technique~\cite{CMS-PAS-PFT-09-001}, which combines
information from several subdetectors.  The anti-\kt
clustering algorithm~\cite{antikt,fastjetmanual} with a distance
parameter of 0.5 is used.  Jets that overlap with isolated leptons
within $\Delta R=0.3$ are not considered.  Jet energy corrections are
applied to account for the non-linear response of the calorimeters to
the particle energies and other instrumental effects~\cite{jetpas}.
These corrections are based on in-situ measurements using dijet,
$\gamma+{\rm jet}$, and Z+jet data samples~\cite{Chatrchyan:2011ds}.
Overlapping minimum bias events from other pp collisions (pileup) and 
the underlying event add to the energy of the
reconstructed jets.  The median energy density due to pileup is
evaluated in each event and the corresponding energy is subtracted
from each jet~\cite{fastjet1}.  In addition, charged particles with tracks
that do not originate from the primary vertex are not considered for jet
clustering~\cite{Cacciari:2008gn}.  
We verify that the procedures
sucessfully remove the dependence of jet response on the number of
interactions in a single event.
A jet quality requirement,
primarily based on the energy balance between charged and neutral
hadrons in a jet, is applied to remove misidentified jets.  Only
events containing exactly two jets with $\pt>35$\GeVnn and within $|\eta|<2.4$
are selected for the analysis.  To reduce contamination from \ttbar
background, events are discarded if one or more jets pass
high-efficiency b-quark jet identification criteria based on the
presence of a secondary vertex within the jet~\cite{btag}.  An
accurate $\MET$ measurement is essential to distinguish the W
signal from multijet backgrounds and to reconstruct the full event
kinematics of the WW system.  We use $\MET$ measured in the event
using the full particle-flow reconstruction~\cite{Chatrchyan:2011tn}.
%%The $\MET$ resolution, measured as a
%%function of the sum $\ET$ ($\sum\ET$) of the particle-flow objects in the
%%event, varies from 4\% at $\sum\ET=60\GeVnn$ to 10\% at 
%%$\sum\ET=350\GeVnn$~\cite{Chatrchyan:2011tn}.
and require $\MET>25$ (30)\GeVnn in the event in case of muon (electron) data.
To reduce the background from processes that do not contain 
$\textnormal{W}\to\ell\nu$ decays, we require that the transverse 
mass~\cite{VBTF} of the W candidate be larger than 30\GeVnn (50\GeVnn) 
in muon (electron) data.


We determine the relative contribution of the known SM processes to
the observed dijet mass (\mjj) spectrum using an unbinned maximum likelihood fit over
the mass range 40-150\GeVnn.  The fit is performed separately
for the electron and muon channels since their relative background compositions differ.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Table~\ref{tab:Table0} lists the SM processes included in the fit.
The normalization of the diboson WW+WZ contribution is a free
fit parameter. The normalizations of the background components
are allowed to vary within a Gaussian constraint around their central
values. For multijet events, this central value is obtained from a
separate two-component fit to the $\MET$ distribution
which determines the fake W fraction in data~\cite{VBTF}.   
The constraint is determined by the corresponding uncertainty. 
The central values for all other processes are obtained from
next-to-leading order (NLO) or higher order calculations, and
the constraints are taken from the theoretical uncertainties.  With the
exception of multijet production, the shape of the \mjj template distribution
for all processes is obtained from simulation.  Multijet
events contribute to the total background when jets are misidentified as isolated
leptons. Hence their \mjj shape can be derived from data events with
lepton candidates that fail the isolation requirements.


The \mjj spectrum of the dominant W+jets component is 
described using the shape from \MADGRAPH simulation after taking into account 
the uncertainties due to the factorization and renormalization scale 
(both equal to $q$) and ME--PS matching scale $\mu$~\cite{Alwall:2007fs}:
\begin{linenomath}
\begin{align}
F_{\text{W+jets}} = \alpha\, & \mathcal{F}_{\text{W+jets}} (\mu_{0}^2, q'^2) + 
\beta\, \mathcal{F}_{\text{W+jets}} (\mu'^2, q_{0}^2) \nonumber \\ 
&+ (1-\alpha-\beta)\, \mathcal{F}_{\text{W+jets}} (\mu_{0}^2, q_{0}^2)\,,
\label{eqWpjetsShape}
\end{align}
\end{linenomath}
where $\mathcal{F}_{\text{W+jets}}$ denotes the \mjj shape from
simulation.  The parameters $\mu_0$ ($\mu'$) and $q_0$ ($q'$)
correspond to the default (alternative) values of $\mu$ and $q$,
respectively. The parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are
free to vary between 0 and 1.  We take $\mu' = 2 \mu_0$ or $0.5 \mu_0$
($q' = 2 q_0$ or $0.5 q_0$), depending on which alternative sample
provides a better fit to the data. 
Thus, the fit probes a factor of two variations in both $\mu$ and  $q$.

Figure~\ref{fig:Fig1}(a) shows the observed \mjj distribution for 
both channels combined, together with the fitted projections of the
contribution of various SM processes.  Figure~\ref{fig:Fig1}(b)
shows the same distribution after subtracting all SM contributions
from data except for electroweak diboson WW+WZ events.  
Figure~\ref{fig:Fig1}(c) shows the pull distribution;
i.e., the normalized residual defined as $(\text{data} -
\text{fit})/(\text{fit~uncertainty})$, where fit uncertainty 
is computed at each data point by propagating the 
uncertainty in the normalization coefficients. 
The yields of various SM components, as determined by the fit, 
are reported in Table~\ref{tab:yields}. 


We validate the fit procedure by performing pseudo-experiments.  In
each experiment, we generate the \mjj pseudo-data for the SM processes,
taking into account the correlation among the yields, and then perform a fit
to each pseudo-data \mjj distribution.  
The results for both muon and electron channels
indicate that there is a small bias on the
WW+WZ yield that is below 0.4 standard deviations and that the 
fit overestimates the yield
uncertainty slightly. These effects are corrected for in the final
result.  


Uncertainties due to the jet energy are estimated from a sample of
W bosons decaying hadronically in a highly pure sample of semileptonic 
\ttbar\ events.  The mean and resolution of the reconstructed dijet
mass distribution in data agree to within 0.6\% of
the expectations from simulation.  A small difference in \MET
resolution~\cite{Chatrchyan:2011tn} between data and simulation
affects the signal acceptance at the 0.5\% level.  
Further systematic uncertainties
are due to the uncertainty on the trigger efficiency in
data (1\%), and on the lepton reconstruction and
selection efficiencies (2\%)~\cite{VBTF}.  
The uncertainty due to b-jet veto is negligible. 
The uncertainty 
in the luminosity determination is 2.2\%~\cite{lumiPAS}.
The uncertainty in acceptance arising from theoretical uncertainties,
including parton distribution functions and additional jet rejection, is 4\%. 


As listed in Table~\ref{tab:yields}, we 
observe 2700 $\pm$ 340 (stat.) $\pm$ 360 (syst.) WW+WZ events, 
in agreement with the SM expectation. 
This result corresponds to a significance of 8.8 standard deviations  
when computed using a simple likelihood 
ratio, where the nuisance parameters~\cite{Junk:1999kv} are fixed to their nominal fit 
values.
Using the profile likelihood ratio~\cite{Junk:1999kv}, 
where the nuisance parameters are allowed to vary, the significance 
becomes 4.3 standard deviations.
We compute the WW+WZ total cross section as 
$\sigma = N_{\text{Sig}}/ (\mathcal{A} \, \varepsilon \, {\mathcal{L}})$, 
where $N_{\text{Sig}}$ is the number of extracted signal events,
$\mathcal{A}$ is the signal acceptance corrected for the branching fractions,
$\varepsilon$ is the efficiency for all requirements on 
the event selection, and ${\mathcal{L}}$ is the integrated luminosity. 
In the acceptance calculation we assume the SM value for WW to WZ production ratio. 
The values of $N_{\text{Sig}}$ and $\mathcal{A}\varepsilon$ 
are given in Table~\ref{tab:yields} separately for the muon and electron channels.
Combining the results from the muon and electron channels, we obtain 
$\sigma = 68.9 \pm 8.7 \text{ (stat.)} \pm 9.7 \text{ (syst.)}  \pm 1.5 \text{ (lum.)}$~pb, 
which is in agreement with the NLO prediction~\cite{Campbell:2011bn} 
$65.6 \pm 2.2$~pb that includes the contribution from $gg\to\text{WW}$.

Measurements of diboson production translate into measurements of 
gauge boson self-couplings, which are one of the most fundamental 
aspects of the electroweak sector of the SM. 
At the leading order, only s-channel $q\overline{q}$ annihilation 
diagrams have a three-boson vertex: WW$\gamma$ and WWZ couplings 
in WW production and WWZ coupling in WZ production.
%%In the SM, these couplings are defined  up to an overall constant. 
Physics beyond the SM can modify these couplings, leading to 
observable differences in the cross section and the kinematic 
distributions~\cite{Dixon:1999di}. 
We search for anomalous triple gauge couplings (aTGC) using an effective 
Lagrangian described by the HISZ parametrization 
without form factors~\cite{PhysRevD.48.2182}.
%%%The corresponding coupling value with a conventional dipole form factor can 
%%%be obtained by dividing by the term $(1+s/\Lambda^2)^2$, where 
%%%$s$ is the center-of-mass energy and $\Lambda$ is some 
%%%arbitrary cutoff scale in TeV range~\cite{Dixon:1999di}.
We use the dijet $p_T$ distribution, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Fig2}, 
as the observable after requiring  $75~\GeVnn < \mjj < 95~\GeVnn$ to enhance signal purity. 
The dependence of the distribution on specific aTGC 
is modeled by reweighting the \PYTHIA simulation of WW+WZ to 
the \MCFM~\cite{MCFM} NLO predictions. 
We account for systematic uncertainties arising from luminosity,
signal selection efficiency, signal shape, 
and from the normalization and shape of the SM processes.
We find no evidence for aTGC.
Given the tight bound on the parameter $\Delta{g_1^Z}$~\cite{pdg} 
we assume the SM value~($\Delta{g_1^Z}$=0), and set upper limits on 
the two parameters $\lambda$ and $\Delta{\kappa_\gamma}$.  
Upper limits at 95\% confidence level (CL) in the two-dimensional 
$\lambda-\Delta{\kappa_\gamma}$ plane
computed using the modified frequentist CL${}_{S}$~\cite{Junk:1999kv,CLS} 
technique, with profile likelihood as the test statistic,  
are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Fig3}. 
We obtain the following one-dimensional observed 95\% 
CL upper limits assuming the SM value for the other parameter: 
$ -0.038 < \lambda < 0.030$, 
$ -0.11 < \Delta{\kappa_\gamma} < 0.14$.
These limits are competitive with, and in some cases improve upon, 
the sensitivity of the combined LEP experiments listed in 
Refs.~\cite{pdg,Abdallah:2008sf,Schael:2004tq,Abbiendi:2003mk,Achard:2004ji}. 
The ATLAS Collaboration recently reported
limits in the fully leptonic channel for WZ production in Ref.~\cite{ATLAS:2012wz}: 
$ -0.046 < \lambda < 0.047$, 
$ -0.37 < \Delta{\kappa_\gamma} < 0.57$. 
Fully leptonic channel limits are weaker due to lower branching fraction.
%%The corresponding expected exclusion limits are 
%%$ -0.041 < \Lambda_Z  < 0.035$, $ -0.12 < \Delta{\kappa_\gamma} < 0.16$.
%%These limits are consistent with the SM prediction.

In summary, a measurement of the sum of WW and WZ production cross sections  
has been performed using events containing a W and two non-b jets.
The measured value for the cross section is 
$68.9 \pm 8.7 \text{ (stat.)} \pm 9.7 \text{ (syst.)}  \pm 1.5 \text{ (lum.)}$~pb, 
which is consistent with the SM prediction. 
No evidence for anomalous triple gauge couplings is found,  
and upper limits are set on their magnitude.
