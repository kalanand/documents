%%\section{Introduction}
The pair production of vector bosons allows a direct 
test of their self-interactions, which are predicted by the 
gauge symmetry of the standard model (SM)~\cite{PhysRevD.48.2182}. 
Observations of anomalous couplings would be an indication of physics beyond
the SM.
Also, the SM Higgs boson may decay to WW, giving rise to the same 
final state as in direct diboson production. 


In this letter we report the first observation of WW+WZ diboson 
production in the semi-leptonic final state at the LHC.
One W boson decays leptonically while the other boson 
(W or Z) decays hadronically, giving rise to two energetic jets in 
the final state.
Previous measurements in this channel at the Tevatron p$\overline{\rm p}$ 
collider include the recent CDF~\cite{CDF-diboson-lvjj-2010} and 
D\O~\cite{Abazov:2011cb, Abazov:2012} results. 
The advantage of reconstructing WW+WZ in $\ell\nu jj$ decay mode over 
the purely leptonic final states is the larger branching fraction to jets, but
at the expense of larger backgrounds (mainly from W+jets).
Compared to the fully leptonic decay of WW pairs, the semi-leptonic 
process permits a direct measurement of the boson transverse 
momentum. 
The sensitivity to very high boson $p_T$ makes this process particularly 
useful as a probe of the gauge symmetries at high energies 
where evidence of physics beyond the SM could appear.



Our data correspond to an integrated luminosity of $5.02 \pm
0.11\fbinv$ collected in 2010 and 2011 with the Compact Muon Solenoid
(CMS) detector in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 7\TeV$ at the CERN
LHC. CMS~\cite{CMS:2010} uses a right-handed coordinate system, with
the origin at the nominal interaction point, the x-axis pointing to
the center of the LHC, the y-axis pointing up perpendicular to the LHC
plane, and the z-axis along the counterclockwise beam direction. The
polar angle $\theta$ is measured from the positive z-axis and the
azimuthal angle $\phi$ is measured in the x-y plane. The
pseudorapidity is defined as $\eta = -\ln(\tan\frac{\theta}{2})$. The
central feature of the CMS apparatus is a superconducting solenoid of
6\unit{m} internal diameter, providing a magnetic field of
3.8\unit{T}. Within the field volume are a silicon pixel and strip
tracker and calorimeters. The tracker covers the range $|\eta| < 2.5$
which, together with the solenoid, provides a track momentum
resolution of 1\% at 100\GeVnn. The lead tungstate crystal
electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) covers $|\eta| < 3$ with an energy
resolution of about $3\%/\sqrt{E}$~\cite{CMS-PAS-EGM-10-003}. The
brass/scintillator hadron calorimeter (HCAL) covers $|\eta| < 5$ with
an energy resolution of $100\%/\sqrt{E}$. The muon system includes the
tracker and gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel return
yoke, and is capable of reconstructing and identifying muons within
$|\eta| < 2.4$. Extensive forward calorimetry complements the coverage
provided by the barrel and endcap detectors. The detector is nearly
hermetic, allowing for measurements of the missing transverse energy
($\MET$) in the event.  A two-tier trigger system selects the events
of interest.


The data were collected with a suite of single-lepton triggers mostly 
using transverse momentum (\PT) thresholds of 24\GeVnn for muons 
and 25-32\GeVnn for electrons. To preferentially select only real W
events, the single-electron triggers typically also require minimum 
thresholds on $\MET$ and the
transverse mass \mt of the electron plus $\MET$ system. 
The overall trigger efficiency is about 94\% (90\%) for muon (electron) data, 
with a small dependence (within a few percent) on \PT and $\eta$. 
Simulated events are corrected for the trigger efficiency.
Although the main sources of background are estimated from data, 
simulated events are used to
develop and validate the methods used in the analysis. 
We use the \MADGRAPH~\cite{MADGRAPH} event
generator and CTEQ6L1 parton distribution functions to simulate the 
W boson and Drell-Yan production
in association with up to four partons. This matrix element (ME) 
calculation is matched to
parton showers (PS) from \PYTHIA 6.422~\cite{PYTHIA} tune 
Z2~\cite{Collaboration:2012tb} with a matching
threshold of 20\GeVnn and a dynamic factorization-renormalization scale given by
{\small $\sqrt{m^{2}_{\textnormal{W/Z}} + p^{2}_{\textnormal{T, W/Z}}}$}.
Top-quark pair (\ttbar) events are also simulated using \MADGRAPH. 
Single-top production is modeled using
{\sc powheg}~\cite{Nason:2004rx,Frixione:2007vw,Alioli:2010xd,Nason:2009ai}. 
Multijet and electroweak diboson processes are simulated using \PYTHIA. 
All simulated events are fully reconstructed using the standard CMS software.






Muons are measured with the all-silicon tracker and the muon system, 
within $|\eta|<2.1$. Electrons are detected as tracks in the tracker 
pointing to energy clusters in the ECAL, within $|\eta|<2.5$, 
excluding the transition region between the barrel and endcap, 
$1.44<|\eta|<1.57$. Muons (electrons) are required to have \PT
greater than 25\GeVnn (35\GeVnn).
To reduce the background from processes that do not contain 
$\textnormal{W}\to\ell\nu$ decays, we require that the transverse 
mass~\cite{VBTF} of the W candidate be larger than 30\GeVnn (50\GeVnn) 
in muon (electron) data.
The lepton candidates are required to be compatible with the primary 
vertex of the event, which is chosen as the vertex with the highest 
$\sum \PT^2$ of its associated tracks. According to the simulation,
this requirement provides the correct assignment for the primary 
vertex in more than 99\% of cases
in both signal and background simulated events. Charged leptons from 
W boson decays are expected to
be isolated from other activity in the event.
Leptons are therefore required to be isolated from hadronic activity 
in the detector by restricting
the sum of transverse momentum or energy in the tracker, ECAL, and HCAL, 
within a surrounding cone
of $\Delta R \equiv \sqrt{(\Delta\eta)^2+(\Delta\phi)^2} <0.3$, to be 
less than 10\% of the measured
$\PT$ of the muon, or less than 5\% of the measured $\PT$ of the electron, 
where $\Delta\eta$ and
$\Delta\phi$ are the differences in pseudorapidity and in azimuthal angle 
in radians, respectively.
To reduce the backgrounds from the Drell-Yan and electroweak diboson 
purely-leptonic decay processes, we exclude events in which there is any other 
loosely identified lepton (with $\PT > 20$\GeVnn for electrons and $\PT>10$\GeVnn
for muons) in the event.


Jets are reconstructed from calorimeter and tracker information using
a particle-flow technique~\cite{CMS-PAS-PFT-09-001}, which combines
information from several subdetectors.  The anti-\kt
clustering algorithm~\cite{antikt,fastjetmanual} with distance
parameter $R=0.5$ is used.  Jets that overlap with isolated leptons
within $\Delta R=0.3$ are not considered.  Jet-energy corrections are
applied to account for the non-linear response of the calorimeters to
the particle energies and other instrumental effects~\cite{jetpas}.
These corrections are based on in-situ measurements using dijet,
$\gamma+{\rm jet}$, and Z+jet data samples~\cite{Chatrchyan:2011ds}.
Overlapping minimum-bias events from other pp collisions (pile-up) and
the underlying event can contribute additional energy to the
reconstructed jets.  The median energy density due to pile-up is
evaluated in each event and the corresponding energy is subtracted
from each jet~\cite{fastjet1}.  In addition, charged-particle tracks
that do not originate from the primary vertex are not considered for jet
clustering~\cite{Cacciari:2008gn}.  A jet-quality requirement,
primarily based on the energy balance between charged and neutral
hadrons in a jet, is applied to remove misidentified jets.  Only
events containing two jets with $\PT>35$\GeVnn and within $|\eta|<2.6$
are selected for the analysis.  To reduce contamination from \ttbar
background, events are discarded if one or more jets pass
high-efficiency b-quark jet identification criteria based on the
presence of a secondary vertex within the jet~\cite{btag}.  An
accurate $\MET$ measurement is essential to distinguish the W
signal from multijet backgrounds and to reconstruct the full event
kinematics of the WW system.  We use $\MET$ measured in the event
using the full particle-flow reconstruction~\cite{Chatrchyan:2011tn}.
%%The $\MET$ resolution, measured as a
%%function of the sum $\ET$ ($\sum\ET$) of the particle-flow objects in the
%%event, varies from 4\% at $\sum\ET=60\GeVnn$ to 10\% at 
%%$\sum\ET=350\GeVnn$~\cite{Chatrchyan:2011tn}.
We require $\MET>25$ (30)\GeVnn in the event in case of muon (electron) data.





We determine the relative contribution of the known SM processes to
the observed \mjj spectrum using an unbinned maximum-likelihood fit over
the range 40-200\GeVnn.  The fit is performed separately
for the electron and muon channels since their relative background compositions differ.

Table~\ref{tab:Table0} lists the SM processes included in the fit.
The normalization of the diboson WW+WZ contribution is a free
fit parameter. The normalizations of the background components
are allowed to vary within a Gaussian constraint around their central
values. For multijet events, this central value is obtained from a
separate fit to the $\MET$ distribution in data~\cite{VBTF}, and the
constraint is determined by the corresponding fit error estimate. The
central values for all other processes are obtained from
next-to-leading order (NLO) or next-to-NLO (NNLO) calculations, and
the constraints are taken from the theoretical uncertainties.  With the
exception of multijet production, the \mjj template distribution
shapes for all processes are obtained from simulation.  Multijet
events contribute to the total background when jets are misidentified as isolated
leptons. Hence their \mjj shape can be derived from data events with
lepton candidates that fail the isolation requirements.


The \mjj spectrum of the dominant W+jets component is 
described using the \MADGRAPH shape after taking into account 
the uncertainties due to the factorization-renormalization scale 
($q$) and ME--PS matching scale $\mu$:
\begin{linenomath}
\begin{align}
F_{\text{W+jets}} = \alpha\, & \mathcal{F}_{\text{W+jets}} (\mu_{0}^2, q'^2) + 
\beta\, \mathcal{F}_{\text{W+jets}} (\mu'^2, q_{0}^2) \nonumber \\ 
&+ (1-\alpha-\beta)\, \mathcal{F}_{\text{W+jets}} (\mu_{0}^2, q_{0}^2)\,,
\label{eqWpjetsShape}
\end{align}
\end{linenomath}
where $\mathcal{F}_{\text{W+jets}}$ denotes the \mjj shape from
simulation.  The parameters $\mu_0$ ($\mu'$) and $q_0$ ($q'$)
correspond to the default (alternative) values of $\mu$ and $q$,
respectively. The fractional contributions $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are
free to vary between 0 and 1.  We take $\mu' = 2 \mu_0$ or $0.5 \mu_0$
($q' = 2 q_0$ or $0.5 q_0$), depending on which alternative sample
provides a better fit to the data.

Figure~\ref{fig:Fig1}(a) shows the observed \mjj distribution for 
both channels combined, together with the fitted projections of the
contribution of various SM processes.  Figure~\ref{fig:Fig1}(b)
shows the same distribution after subtracting all SM contributions
from data except for electroweak diboson WW+WZ events.  
Figure~\ref{fig:Fig1}(c) shows the pull distribution;
i.e., the normalized residual defined as $(\text{data} -
\text{fit})/\text{fit~uncertainty}$.  Table~\ref{tab:yields} presents the
yields of the various SM components as predicted by the fit. 


We validate the fit procedure by performing pseudo-experiments.  In
each experiment, we generate the \mjj pseudo-data of the SM processes,
taking into account the correlation among the yields, and then fit
each pseudo-data sample.  The results for both muon and electron channels
indicate that there is a small bias on the
WW+WZ yield that is below 0.4 standard deviations and that the 
fit overestimates the yield
uncertainty slightly. These effects are corrected for in the final
result.  Uncertainties in the jet energy are estimated from a sample of
W bosons decaying hadronically in a highly pure sample of semi-leptonic
\ttbar\ events.  The mean and resolution of the reconstructed dijet
mass distribution in data agree to within 0.6\% of
the expectations from simulation.  A small difference in \MET
resolution~\cite{Chatrchyan:2011tn} between data and simulation
affects the signal acceptance at the 0.5\% level.  
Further systematic uncertainties
are due to the uncertainty on the trigger efficiency in
data (1\%), and on the lepton reconstruction and
selection efficiencies (2\%)~\cite{VBTF}.  The uncertainty
in the luminosity determination is 2.2\%~\cite{lumiPAS}.
The uncertainty in acceptance arising from theoretical uncertainties,
including parton distribution functions and additional jet rejection, is 4\%. 


With the kinematic requirements imposed in this analysis, we 
observe 2682 $\pm$ 339 (stat) $\pm$ 357 (syst) WW+WZ events, 
in agreement with the SM expectation. 
This corresponds to a significance of 8.8 standard deviations (s.d.) 
when computed using a simple likelihood 
ratio, where the nuisance parameters are fixed to their nominal fit 
values.
Using the profile likelihood ratio, where the nuisance parameters are 
allowed to vary, the significance 
becomes 4.3 s.d.
We compute the WW+WZ cross section as 
$\sigma = N_{\text{Sig}}/ (\mathcal{A} \, \varepsilon \, {\mathcal{L}})$, 
where $N_{\text{Sig}}$ is the number of extracted signal events,
$\mathcal{A}$ is the signal acceptance corrected for the branching fractions,
$\varepsilon$ is the efficiency for all requirements on 
the event selection, and ${\mathcal{L}}$ is the integrated luminosity.
The values of $N_{\text{Sig}}$ and $\mathcal{A}\varepsilon$ 
are given in Table~\ref{tab:yields} separately for the muon and electron channels.
Combining the results from the muon and electron channels, we obtain 
$\sigma = 68.89 \pm 8.71 \text{(stat)} \pm 9.70 \text{(syst)}  \pm 1.52 \text{(lumi)}$~pb, 
which is in agreement with the NLO prediction~\cite{Campbell:2011bn} 
$65.6 \pm 2.2$~pb that includes the contribution from $gg\to\text{WW}$.

Gauge boson self-couplings probe some of the most fundamental aspects of the SM 
electroweak theory. 
At the leading order, only s-channel $q\overline{q}$ annihilation 
diagrams have a three-boson vertex: WW$\gamma$ and WWZ couplings 
in WW production and WWZ coupling in WZ production.
%%In the SM, these couplings are defined  up to an overall constant. 
Contributions to these couplings from non-SM physics processes would 
affect the measured WW+WZ cross section and the kinematic 
distributions~\cite{Dixon:1999di}. 
We search for anomalous gauge couplings using an effective 
Lagrangian described by the HISZ parametrization~\cite{PhysRevD.48.2182} 
without form factors.
%%%The corresponding coupling value with a conventional dipole form factor can 
%%%be obtained by dividing by the term $(1+s/\Lambda^2)^2$, where 
%%%$s$ is the center-of-mass energy and $\Lambda$ is some 
%%%arbitrary cutoff scale in TeV range~\cite{Dixon:1999di}.
We find no evidence for anomalous couplings 
and set upper limits on their magnitude.
Given the tight bound on parameter $\Delta{g_1^Z}$~\cite{pdg} 
we assume the SM value~($\Delta{g_1^Z}$=0), and set limits on 
the two parameters $\lambda_Z$ and $\Delta{\kappa_\gamma}$.  
We use the dijet $p_T$ distribution, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Fig2}, 
as the observable after requiring  $75~\GeVnn < \mjj < 95~\GeVnn$. 
The dependence of the distribution on specific anomalous couplings 
is modeled by reweighting the Pythia simulation of WW+WZ to 
the MCFM~\cite{MCFM} NLO predictions. 
We account for systematic uncertainties arising from luminosity,
signal selection efficiency, signal shape, and from the normalization and shape of the SM processes.
Upper limits in the 2-dimensional $\lambda_Z-\Delta{\kappa_\gamma}$ plane
are computed using the modified frequentist construction known as
CL${}_{S}$~\cite{CLS},
with profile likelihood as the test statistic, and 
are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Fig3}. At the 95\% confidence level (CL) 
we obtain the following 1-dimensional observed upper limits 
assuming the SM value for the other parameter: 
$ -0.038 < \lambda_Z < 0.030$, 
$ -0.111 < \Delta{\kappa_\gamma} < 0.142$.
These limits are competitive with, and in some cases exceed, the sensitivity of the combined LEP experiments
listed in 
Refs.~\cite{pdg,Abdallah:2008sf,Schael:2004tq,Abbiendi:2003mk,Achard:2004ji} 
with uncertainty at the 68\% CL. The ATLAS Collaboration recently reported
limits in the fully leptonic channel for WZ production in Ref.~\cite{ATLAS:2012wz}.
%%The corresponding expected exclusion limits are
%%$ -0.041 < \Lambda_Z  < 0.035$, $ -0.12 < \Delta{\kappa_\gamma} < 0.16$.
%%These limits are consistent with the SM prediction.

In summary, a measurement of the sum of WW and WZ production cross sections  
has been performed using events containing a W and two non-b jets.
The measured value for the cross section is 
$68.89 \pm 8.71 \text{(stat)} \pm 9.70 \text{(syst)}  \pm 1.52 \text{(lumi)}$~pb, 
which is consistent with the SM prediction. 
No evidence for anomalous gauge couplings is found,  
and upper limits are set on their magnitude.
