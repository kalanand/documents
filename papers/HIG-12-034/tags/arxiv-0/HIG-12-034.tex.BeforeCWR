\abstract{
A search for a standard-model-like Higgs boson in the $\PH \to \WW$ and $\PH \to \ZZ$ decay channels
is reported, for mass hypotheses in the range $145 < \mH < 1000\GeV$. The search is based upon
proton-proton collision data samples corresponding to an integrated luminosity
of up to 5.1 ${\rm fb}^{-1}$ at $\sqrt{s} = 7\TeV$
and up to 5.3 ${\rm fb}^{-1}$ at $\sqrt{s} = 8\TeV$, recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC. 
The measured combined
upper limits at 95\% confidence level on products of the cross-section and branching 
fractions 
%exclude 
for the standard-model-like Higgs boson
extend the mass range excluded previously by CMS from
$127<\mH<600\GeV$ to $127<\mH<710\GeV$.
% in the mass
%range $145 < \mH < 710\GeV$.
}

%% ED: The expected limits only go to ~700GeV. It is reasonable to say this is a search up to 1TeV, which implies that we are sensitive across that whole mass range?

% Do not comment out the following hypersetup lines (metadata). They will disappear in NODRAFT mode and are needed by CDS.
% Also: make sure that the values of the metadata items are sensible and are in plain text:

% (2) no %.
% (3) No curly braces {}.
